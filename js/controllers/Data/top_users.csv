0,4386516,"b""Galloping honeypots, Ocha Thai is a find![1] Their plain Jane interior may not impress, but their Thai and Chinese cooking will.\n\nConsidering Ocha is in the shadow of the Stratosphere, they might seem to be a bit of a dive, especially in comparison to other spots on the Strip. On the contrary, Ocha is clean, and their service wicked fast: we were seated, had our orders taken, and got our food before we could blink. For their speed, we never were rushed.\n\nEverything was expertly prepared, from start to finish. We enjoyed their beef jerky appetizer ($8.95) - chunks of tender spiced beef brisket, sundried then deep-fried - as much as the sweet sauce that came on the side. Their chicken tom yum soup (8.95), flavored with mushrooms, lemongrass, chili and lime juice, helped ward off hunger.\n\nFor entrees, try their pad thai chicken (8.95), stir-fried with bean sprouts, and a lime on the side. It's slightly sweet, with a perfect, light texture. A few plates of combination (pork, chicken, beef) fried rice (9.95/plate) rounded off our meal nicely. (Somehow we ended up with sticky rice too, but I didn't try any.)\n\nRecommended for a comfortable, affordable lunch.\n\n[1] Thanks Vy for taking me here!

The Venetian is secure, has a friendly concierge staff that's easy to work with, a convenient mini-store with water, booze, and souvenirs, and a shop where you can do office-type things like buy CD-Rs (I actually needed one during my trip, go figure).\n\nTheir food court is crap, from the Pizzeria da Enzo to the San Gennaro Grill. Roam the strip for more entertaining and less expensive dining options. Heck, even Denny's is more bang for your buck.\n\nLodging is expensive, food is expensive, everything is expensive!

6,4386501,"b""When thinking of casinos off the Strip, there's a temptation to think of them as modest, and merely meant for locals. Red Rock's luxurious facility both surprised and impressed me - there's a lot to do!\n\nThis casino resort has a cornucopia of features, including a bowling alley, spa, food court, multiple restaurants, and conference center capabilities. Their hotel lobby lounge features a 32-foot long chandelier, draped by an elegant staircase. There's a few stores, and a Starbucks overlooking the lobby. The casino's decor is sharp, and the restaurants lining it mirror that theme. The nearly 3,000 slot machines can confound if you're trying to find people, so pay attention to your surroundings.\n\nWe had a spacious suite near the spa, with a view of the Strip and top-notch amenities: modern decor, huge soft mattresses, a comfy couch, a widescreen plasma TV, and a convenient bottle of Patron (costs extra). Loved the bathroom, and the luxurious shower. The toilet had a phone by it, and the marble tub, a TV. Besides hearing wind whistling one morning (it was crazy windy out there), Red Rock's hotel, casino, and lounges all had a fit and finish that made our dollars feel well-spent.\n\nHotel service was stellar. When I needed help late-night, both Tanya (at the front desk) and a bellhop assisted. When we needed a random feminine hygiene product, not only did room service stock necessities, a staffer delivered the goods to our door minutes later. When hunger hit, concierge Stephanie pointed out some nearby Thai restaurants.\n\nIf you're planning on heading to the Strip, keep in mind that Red Rock is off-strip. If you're content with hailing a taxi, or are a local, this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nMy single regret from my stay at Red Rock?

It\'s a steal for the taste and refreshment, and a perfect nightcap before ending the night in Scottsdale. \n\nAll in all, this proved to be quite the unexpected gem in a swath of muted colors and cacti as far as the eye can see.

Because I\'ve been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it\'s much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.\n\nOn a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can\'t imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city.

0,1992151,"b""Until the Red Rock (http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2) came along, the Green Valley Ranch was option numero uno among the growing property list of the Station Casino empire. It was and still is a very complete resort, a property with a little bit of everything. GVR recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, which in Vegas years means the novelty has worn off slightly. Despite that, it remains a great destination for all and is a great value for any stay.\n\nSimilarly to Red Rock, GVR is off the strip. So off as a matter of fact, it's in Henderson (i.e. not Las Vegas). Relax I-only-stay-on-the-strip fans, it's a 10-15 minute shuttle ride at best from McCarran airport and is probably faster to get to than the Sahara, which is technically still on the strip. But like any good off strip property and especially those in Henderson, it means this joint is likely a locals casino (#1).\n\nAs a hotel, GVR is definitely delivers. There are a multitude of room types, all of which are modern, contemporary, and feature some of the most comfy beds I've slept in. Everything from the regular sized rooms to the mega suites that could sleep 30, are available and for far more reasonable prices than most of the ones along Las Vegas Blvd. And at nearly 500 of them, there is plenty to choose from. I say, try to score a room near their pools - the view of the strip is nice, as is the amenities poolside.\n\nCasino enthusiasts should be able to appreciate the large casino space, which offers over 70 table games and over 2,000 gaming machines. Blackjack fans should be able to get their fill of over 30 tables dedicated to the game and poker fans will have a  decent variety of games to chose from as well. Their player rewards program is competitive, comp points from play is definitely transferrable to other Station properties. Dealers are usually quite friendly and the cigarette smoke is controlled rather well for a large space. The cocktail staff could definitely use an upgrade, but I digress.\n\nIn terms of eats, there is a decent selection but the outstanding venues are a bit limited. Hank's Steaks & Martinis (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson) is the obvious winner of the bunch and then there is the pitiful TIdes Oyster Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tides-oyster-bar-henderson). I echo the pains of eating at Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-cafe-henderson) though the Feast (Around The World) Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/feast-buffet-henderson-3) has been fantastic and mediocre at varying times. It's no In-N-Out, but Fatburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fatburger-henderson-2) is gut bustingly good. Sushi + Sake (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-sake-las-vegas) is a fun time, especially for their AYCE deal. Italian joint Terra Verde (http://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-verde-henderson) is decent during lunch, though I much preferred it when Hell's Kitchen winner Rock was still running the show.\n\nGVR has a lot of random amenities, which really distinguish it from it's nearby (or far away depending on how you look at it) properties. Like the Red Rock, there is a movie theater. The Pond (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pond-henderson), is a real cool and relaxing alternative to their sick pools. A great place to catch an outdoor concert is at The Backyard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-backyard-henderson) and Ovation (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovation-henderson) is a real concert venue. Every casino has a center floor bar and in GVR's case, it's the Drop Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/drop-bar-henderson). I'd also recommend visiting the Lobby Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobby-bar-henderson) as it's probably the closest thing to a club GVR has. The property may not boast a lot of shopping, but it sits right next to The District (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-district-at-green-valley-ranch-henderson), a village of boutique and luxury stores, just perfect for those looking for an escape from the casino. It's rarely ever crowded, but then again, neither is the casino.\n\nThough GVR could probably use an upgrade on a few things, the property itself is good enough to warrant a 4.5 star rating. It's versatile, stylish, and spacious enough for all visitors. Folks who are teetering the idea of staying off the strip with almost everything at their disposal, should consider GVR as their next destination.\n___________\n(#1) This is a very, very good thing.""",5,6kkxRV8H9SQLybj0xnEbMw,2,b'1ekmjgWn1knK55pbyH_1Kg',b'2012-01-08',5,2,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,68,"""Green Valley Ranch Resort & Spa""",Anthem,"""2300 Paseo Verde Pkwy""",Henderson,NV,89052,36.020552,-115.089984,3.5,756,1,Resorts;Hotels;Day Spas;Beauty & Spas;Hotels & Travel;Casinos;Arts & Entertainment;Event Planning & Services

2,2054790,"b""One of the Montreal's most well known steakhouses became the site of our most epic dinner during my friend's bachelor party weekend. In the midst of planning for the dinner, there was a tossup decision between this place and cross town rival Gibby's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gibbys-restaurant-montreal). The deliberation ended with Queue de Cheval for one thing: amazing service. From the phone reservation to greeting us at the door to the end of the meal, they did one heck of a job in accommodating our party of 12 hungry men.\n\nFrom the outside into the lobby, it's easy to see how beautiful this restaurant really is. In true steakhouse fashion, there are various cuts of meat from all parts of the world on display, something a true meat connoisseur can surely appreciate. We were able to get a spot on the second floor facing the street and the restaurant was like many other upscale steakhouses: trendy decor, well dressed patrons and wait staff, a lively ambiance just buzzing with activity. \n\nGenerally speaking, the food always takes precedence in any restaurant but in places like this, service is of the utmost importance. The wait staff was quick and handled everything with ease, we almost never had to ask for anything as water was filled quickly, bread was refilled automatically, and there was never any attitude. Our main waiter was sharp, humorous, and extremely knowledgeable about virtually every item on the menu and was able to make some killer recommendations for drinks and food. We decided to pass on their appetizers, a majority of which would sully our carnivorous appetite for the one thing we came for - steak. Almost all of us were sold on the 20oz Lou's Cut ($54), which is the place's most popular steak.\n\nAlong with the steak we ordered multiple sides of creamed corn ($12), truffle and parmesan fries ($7), garlic mashed potatoes ($5), along with a heaping of steak sauces: veal and truffle reduction ($6), cognac peppercorn ($6), and a cabernet sauvignon demi glace ($6) and staring at us was a hell of a meal.\n\nEverything was fantastic. The creaminess of the garlic mash, coupled by the delicious sauteed garlic spinach was melt in your mouth good. There were multiple foodgasms galore over the Lou's Cut, a hearty Colorado imported hunk of steak heaven in it's medium rare glory, juicy and went great with everything. The steak sauces weren't even all that necessary, but once added, there was no going back. Every bite was enhanced, the flavors were so rich, it was just the perfect amount of food; life was suddenly perfect.   \n\nAlong with the Australian red and whites we sipped throughout the night, including 4 orders every side and a Lou's cut, the price we paid (sans the bachelor of course) was a very reasonable $82 per person. The conversation was as excellent as the food which was stellar as the service. Steakhouses might feel a tad more expensive in Montreal, mainly due to the importing of all of the meat, but when in town, this is one of the best places for steak period.\n\nHere's a parting thought for everyone: http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Ek4sVcvmACWp8P1yizjwZg?select=NCkeuXRvI3XEOftyy2x7EQ""",8,Ek4sVcvmACWp8P1yizjwZg,8,b'w6r9LJ_MA6-fJeIVgUZL7g',b'2011-10-02',5,4,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,51,"""Queue de Cheval""",Ville-Marie,"""1181 Rue de la Montagne""",Montréal,QC,H3G 1Z2,45.4971983,-73.5732314,3,135,1,Restaurants;Steakhouses

This isn\'t the bowling hall that Roy Munson played in (http://www.gapintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/munson.jpg), it\'s the tricked out version appropriate for all ages with over 70 lanes.\n\nThere is plenty of dedicated space per lane, comfy seats for big groups, and lots of tables for folks just looking to grab a bite. The catering is a tad expensive (bowling isn\'t exactly cheap either) but this is Summerlin, not Fremont. As with most larger bowling alleys, there is an arcade, big and extensive with most of the latest games. I only wish this place was around when I was a little kid.\n\nWhat put Red Rock over the top for me was their VIP bowling area. Granted I thought it was a silly (read: hilarious) take for a bowling experience, having experienced it myself I can\'t say enough amazing things about this segregated portion of the place. The ambient lighting was totally club worthy and the lanes are truly apart from the rest of the venue. There is something comical yet interesting about sipping cocktails and sitting on plush furniture while watching someone bowl. But to suggest that it\'s not fun (especially in good company) would be blasphemy.\n\nMidnight bowling after a movie in the nearby theaters is a great way to spend an evening without having to go to the strip. I\'ve brought many bowler enthusiasts to Red Rock Lanes and many of them have arrived at the same conclusion as I:  ""This place is amazing.""'",5,pQL52VHs4i3-y7zq81kFng,5,b'-384TwdQBUMFZLn9TFIvRA',b'2011-09-19',5,2,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,47,"""Red Rock Lanes""",South Summerlin,"""11011 W Charleston Blvd""",Las Vegas,NV,89135,36.154884,-115.335654,3.5,146,1,Active Life;Bowling
4,1992162,"b""Upstairs is Montreal's finest jazz venue and one of the city's local gems. Its a small and intimate, a perfect spot for any date and a fun way to spend an evening sipping on drinks, grabbing a bite, and listening to some of the best live music in the area. \n \nJoel Giberovitch opened this neat little jazz joint nearly 20 years ago, which has gained a notable amount of popularity, especially in the last decade. His inspirations from his past  trips to legendary New York jazz are an obvious influence in the makeup of his decor, which include wooden panels, brick walls, a lengthy yet cozy bar, and classy linens draping each table. If that doesn't establish the mood, I don't know what does. Seating is tight of course, but group dining is very possible here; I would highly recommend reservations.\n\nThough it's been touted as a fun lunch spot, I'm more of a fan during their showcase nights which happen every Friday and Saturday. There is usually a cover charge before midnight, which was about $5 last time I checked. Groups of 4 or more are almost guaranteed a wait, but if you don't listen to jazz often, then take it like a champ and wait it out.\n\nIf the music isn't worth it (but of course it is), then consider the food and the drinks. Much of the menu is distinctly American, with quite few dishes named after notable states in the South, the birth place of jazz. Another portion of the menu is tapas, which is more bar food (nachos, quesadillas, fries, etc.) than they are classic Spanish small plates. I've enjoyed their food overall, as I've had good results with their pappardelle verona, their New Orleans filet mignon, and their array of tasty burgers. Try any of their martinis or get a wine to be paired with the food.\n\nThen of course there's the music. Live jazz doesn't have to be during Montreal Jazz Festival, it can be had here on a much more casual level. The music has always taken precedence and has been a treat every time. I could probably not even eat anything and just sit to enjoy the performances, which vary from a wide range of local and visiting musicians.\n\nI think very highly of this place and hope it continues to do well. I haven't gone to Montreal as often lately and want Upstairs to keep the drinks flowing and the music going. If only I could write their name upside down (see pics for reference).""",7,gZf3RWyaydT8bAK5yw-5xQ,4,b'ygOqwSP20pttX76MPUe3rw',b'2012-01-11',5,5,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,46,"""Upstairs Jazz Bar & Grill""",Ville-Marie,"""1254 Rue Mackay""",Montréal,QC,H3G 2H4,45.4953218,-73.5764586,4,69,1,Arts & Entertainment;Nightlife;Jazz & Blues
5,1992163,"b""The Wynn just knows how to do it right.  Much like the the only 5 star hotel in Vegas, Tryst manages to keep itself above the rest of the competition for being one of the best places in Vegas to party.  With a very organized staff, excellent management, awesome decor, with an outstanding array of music and with plenty of diverse eye candy, it doesn't really get much better than this.\n\nLike all Vegas nightclubs, getting in touch with a promoter is essential.  Unless one has been in the front of the line for awhile, its the best option to get in here before the wait becomes too overwhelming.  Having a lot of girls in the group doesn't hurt either, but I digress.\n\nThe club is beautiful. The posh interior is a great mix of chic with a dash of class.  Ample plush lounges surround the dance floor and the place is definitely on par with the Wynn's sophisticated theme.  Even the bathrooms which I first predicted to be disgusting and barfed up, were clean and well maintained with attendants.\n\nGetting to the bar is not difficult on some nights (like Thursday), but on the packed weekends it becomes more of a chore than anything.  The best bet would be to secure a table before hand and ordering from a cocktail waitress.  At least there is a spot to dump your stuff (if you avoid the $5.00 coat check) and someone who can bring drinks while you and your group are busting a move on the dance floor.  Just don't expect the prices to be anywhere near decent ($12+ per cocktail) but at least the drinks are strong.\n\nDancing here is not as cramped as some other places are along the strip and the music is an excellent mix of everything from Top 40s, Hip Hop, Trance, House, Latin, and Indian music.  Typically they have an outside celebrity DJ scratching up some fresh beats and rarely does it sound like someone is just playing CDs.  Speaking of celebrities, don't be surprised at any random sightings as it is Vegas after all.  A guaranteed find is usually on a weekend night in a VIP booth that is sealed off with a red velvet and a couple of bodyguards -- which usually means they're guarding someone important.\n\nI still remember when this place was called La Bete.

6,2054748,"b'""Cuisine indienne"" as its called in these parts, was a something I was craving for badly during one of my last trips to Montreal. Already a city filled with so many ethnic options, Taj was literally the closest Indian place near our hotel. There are almost always questions for me before I head out to a new place: Is it local? Who goes there? What are the prices? How is the food? etc. Without consultation of my group due to my affinity for Indian cuisine, I immediately set forth for Le Taj and never looked back. \n\nIt so happened to be during their lunch buffet hour, which at that time was priced at $12.95. Even before the clock struck noon, the place was crowded enough to warrant a wait for 4. While I waited I noticed how clean and modern the restaurant was. Some gourmet Indian establishments prefer the maharaja palatial look, where as Le Taj was simple, elegant, and sophisticated.\n\nThe buffet was wonderfully presented. Everything from the serving spoon to the trays they were served in were immaculate. There was a service person on hand to wipe away any immediate spills and adjust items if they were put out of place. I thought the job was a bit tedious and unnecessary initially, but it really does make a difference for how people perceive lunch hour gluttony in buffet form.\n\nThere was an amazing slew of options, with an adequate veggie to meat ratio along with some stellar desserts and sides. All of this food was presented in an open window where someone in the back was baking fresh naan (to be served table side) and dangling along a skewer was some freshly made tandoori chicken. I couldn\'t stop eating the fish curry here, it was perfectly flaky, the curry was rich without all the excess oil. I was also a very impressed with their lamb vindaloo, which was a little bit sweet and a lot savory, I went for seconds only moments after gobbling the first go-around. The naan was fluffy and even fragrant; a puffy bit of goodness that was a great complement to the meal. With the exception of rasmalai and burfi, I am not one for desserts, however the mini-grenade sized galub jamuns were as stellar as I\'ve ever had.\n\nService was quick and professional. They were attentive throughout the experience and were awesome all around. They were also armed with individual credit card machines, which made it an easy process to check out and pay without hassle.\n\nI\'ve been back several times since and I\'ve been quite satisfied each time. The buffet has since surged to $14.95, but with that the options have also been souped up as well. I\'ve eaten some scrumptious veggie dishes (veggie samosa, fried cauliflower, sag paneer, aloo gobi, eggplant) and some excellent meat curries (goat biriyani, sag murgh, chicken makhani), which have all been delicious enough to give this place my blessing.'",12,82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA,6,b'K14of8X9EEzs0l9H5E9kcw',b'2012-02-22',5,5,ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,42,"""Le Taj""",Ville-Marie,"""2077 Rue Stanley""",Montréal,QC,H3A 1R7,45.501105,-73.5766574,4,191,1,Indian;Vegetarian;Vegan;Restaurants

The insatiable appetite for indulgence, the unrelenting yet ever flowing booze from all corners of the town. With the infamous Tijuana chain Tacos El Gordo in the mix, the game has now changed ... for the better. \n\nLocated inside of a strip mall just around the corner of Wynn/Encore, this spot is the perfect alternative to the spendy options of late night spots mid-strip.

I'm usually a huge fan of the Westin and although this particular location isn't as nice as the majority of them worldwide, it still has all the fixings which I love about the Westin.\n\nCheck in was a breeze and friendly. It didn't take much time at all before we were all headed up to our room. I like the fact that this was a smaller hotel and that we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. The other redeeming factor was that it didn't smell like smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casino area, but since it's so small, you don't have a host of people hanging out anyway.\n\nBetween 5 and 7pm, there is a complimentary happy hour for all guests. You can go down to Suede restaurant and enjoy wine, beer, snacks -- all unlimited -- for 2 hrs. We went down and got some fruit, cheese, chips and they had some pretty tasty wine available as well as various beers and soft drinks.\n\nLater, we were making tea in our room and ran out of tea bags, cups and water (they give you Nestle bottled water for free to make tea and coffee with) so we called housekeeping and within 5 mins they had brought us some more.\n\nThe Heavenly bed is out of this world -- I just dozed off in the middle of the afternoon enveloped in its comfort. The shower is another plus with its signature 2 shower heads.\n\nWe did have a problem with the AC as it wouldn't register any lower than 72 degrees. I had set it to 65 degrees before we left to go out for dinner and when we returned, it was the same temp. So I again called downstairs and they sent an engineer within 5 minutes. He brought us a bar of chocolate -- how awesome is that?\n\nHe changed the filter and fixed the problem and was out the door in less than 10 mins. The room remained cool for the whole night. \n\nSo for me, this was an awesome experience. The service was out of this world. My previous experiences with other hotels is that you can call them, but they won't arrive for at least 15-20mins. I would definitely come back again the next time we visit Vegas.

Oatmeal with all the fixins: brown sugar, walnuts, chocolate chips, dried fruit and more....! A perfect alternative to pastries and sugary treats, but still a filling breakfast. I love this. Love, love, love it. It's so simple and so great. Mine was piping hot and kept me full well into the day. SO much better than a muffin, and better for you! Roughly $5.50/bowl. No refills, of course. This ain't a buffet, and how much oatmeal can one really eat, anyway!? I might just put one of these in my house. \n\n*Wonderful coffee and tea offerings served in REAL MUGS if you are hanging out. Not to mention, INTELLIGENTSIA coffee brewed and served. Be still my Chicago-loving heart. \n\n*Bright, clean, spacious, cozy: A fireplace, plenty of sturdy tables and chairs.

Yeah, like those fries would have gotten in my mouth without my full consent. I just happened upon this sparsely decorated eatery on the Yelp app and noticed a lot of approving reviews from what looked like the skinnier Yelpers in the Valley. I don't know Phoenix at all but found myself in what they call the North-Central area of town and there it was in a quiet strip mall.\n\nSteamed chicken aficionado that I am, the funny thing was that I had been wanting Hainan chicken which would have put my vegetarian aspirations on the back burner.

As fate would have it, this place was serving as its daily special the $9.95 Mock Hainan Chicken Rice. Such joyous rapture I felt for the prospect of such a culinary creation that I didn't hesitate to order it. It was surprisingly satisfying with the faux-poultry pinch-hitting quite nicely with the cucumber slices, dipping sauces, and infused rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcE75g).\n\nI also tried the delicious $5.95 Lettuce Wraps, which mixed together sauteed and finely chopped vegan 'meat', mushrooms, water chestnuts, shredded carrot, cilantro leaves, and fried rice noodles into an appetizing filling for the generously sized iceberg lettuce leaves (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcUwXJ). In this case, it was truly indistinguishable from its carnivorous counterpart. Other dishes looked quite tempting as they passed by my table like the Hawaiian Fried Rice and the Rainbow Salad.

1,1477401,"b'The first and last time I saw Bette Midler perform live was ...brace yourself...34 years ago when she was touring to plug one of her early albums. I was a pimply-faced teen who just got my driver\'s license and borrowed my dad\'s aquamarine \'68 Pontiac Catalina to drive to the Berkeley Community Center with a gaggle of like-minded pubescents. I remember not only her repertoire of mostly retro-songs but also her hilarious impersonation of Shelley Winters in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (it requires placing your belly on a barstool). \n\nShe\'s 64 now and looking pretty great all things considered. Her show this past Sunday, cheekily dubbed ""The Showgirl Must Go On"", is not only a tribute to her storied career but also a fresh take on her legendary status amid the recycling of familiar characters from days of yore such as Delores DeLago, the wheelchair-riding mermaid lounge mainstay, and aged chorine Soph, Bette\'s tribute to burlesque comedienne Sophie Tucker. The show starts with a CGI-generated twister on a big screen that segues into Bette singing her big-band number, ""Big Noise from Winnetka"". The energy never flags, least of all Bette, who goes through the mandatory costume changes in record time.\n\nUnlike Cher\'s more contemporary, Cirque-inspired show, Bette\'s is pure vintage Vegas with twenty beautiful showgirls, the Caesar Salad girls, to go along with her back-up trio, the Staggering Harlettes (her term, not mine). The ever-changing sets are elaborate and sumptuous, but nothing overshadows the diminutive Midler. Her voice is the best I\'ve heard it in a long time despite a lost crescendo note on ""When a Man Loves a Woman"". All the hits are here from the kitschy ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B"" (backed by a video of her as the Andrews Sisters circa 1973) to ""The Rose"" (performed as a duet with surprise guest Pink) to her vocal high point, a haunting rendition of John Prine\'s ""Hello in There"". \n\nBut Bette is also a first-class comic providing risque zingers about Celine Dion, Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh and Tiger Woods to make even this fan blush between hysterical fits of laughter (""I guess his wife didn\'t know what he meant when he said he was playing 18 holes.""). The woman just knows how to deliver a punchline. She even sets up her last song with sincere gravity and starts to sing the opening bars of Celine\'s ""My Heart Goes On"" before taking things more seriously with ""Wind Beneath My Wings"". Jamie W. and I had great seats in the rear orchestra section which cost us $145 a piece the day before. Well worth it given that Bette proved to be both a diva and a trouper throughout the ninety-minute set.

2,1288339,"b'Frank Lloyd Wright is the one architect everybody knows, and while I\'ve visited a few of his formative Prairie School buildings like his Oak Park home and studio and the Robie House at my alma mater, University of Chicago (review: http://bit.ly/2rQ0wCE), his more mature works have somehow eluded me, the landmarks that build on his legacy and his love of things organic. Well, except for the Guggenheim Museum which was designed more for its internal configuration to show off art rather than a visual compatibility with NYC\'s Upper East Side. I\'ve always wanted to see Fallingwater in western Pennsylvania. Someday.\n\nAlas, after several half-hearted attempts, I seized an opportunity to visit Taliesin West. This was Wright\'s winter home between 1937 and his death in 1959, and it houses not only his studio but the offices of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and the newly renamed School of Architecture at Taliesin, an exclusive masters-only program that required students to live in desert huts that they would often design themselves. It took me about 45 minutes on a relatively traffic-free Saturday morning to get there from Downtown Phoenix, and quite by design, it\'s not the type of sight you can see easily from the road.\n\nThis was something Wright intentionally did because he wanted the building to look like it came naturally out of the mesa just below McDowell Peak. I made a reservation online a month in advance and splurged by booking the three-hour $75 Behind the Scenes tour. I\'m not exactly sure what is added to the standard one-hour tour except a mid-morning tea in the Dining Room (photo: http://bit.ly/2sRa5pm) where we were regaled with stories of Wright\'s years there by Indira Berndtson, the daughter of one of his few female students back in the 1930\'s, Cornelia Brierly (photo: http://bit.ly/2rKWhx0). \n\nThe tour departed from the gift shop promptly at 9:15AM and began in earnest in the expansive Music Pavilion (photo: http://bit.ly/2sNEjds) where a Lego recreation of the entire complex is presented (photo: http://bit.ly/2tn5zwe). Our guide Myrna appeared to be quite the Wright aficionado who was tested by one precocious German teen who kept interrogating her about architectural details nobody else in the group cared about. She took us to Wright\'s office and also his presentation room (photo: http://bit.ly/2rPUd23). Then we walked around the perimeter of the grounds to take the obligatory panoramic snapshots (photo: http://bit.ly/2tn7Sjb).\n\nAfter our brief sojourn with Indira, we headed to the stunning Garden Room (photo: http://bit.ly/2sRf2yH) where a mosaic from Clare Booth Luce still hangs (photo: http://bit.ly/2tn9F7N) as well as a fine bust of Wright himself (photo: http://bit.ly/2sNluHj). We walked over to his small bedroom in front of the sunken garden and then we walked over to the Sun Cottage, a completely self-sufficient living space decorated in inimitable Wright style (photo: http://bit.ly/2ryqxal). Unfortunately we could only see the Drafting Studio from the outside, and this is where the Guggenheim and other later works were designed from this inception. We ended in the Cabaret Theater, a smaller venue with amazing acoustics (photo: http://bit.ly/2slkdG8).\n\nThe three hours go by quickly, and then you want to go back to the air-conditioned gift shop before facing the full blast of desert heat again. Bring sunscreen because shade is at a premium due to Wright\'s open architectural design. By the way, I can\'t tell you how many times I\'ve seen ""The Fountainhead"", which I thought was Ayn Rand\'s thinly veiled biography of Wright disguised as a novel about individualism. I\'m sure he didn\'t mind being mistaken for Gary Cooper given the 5\'9"" architect looked nothing like the tall, lanky actor. I\'m sure viewing himself as a matinee-idol iconoclast gave him room to be less than kind to his apprentices over the years, but Taliesin West shows that his desert laboratory approach really did work.'",16,#NAME?,11,b'pXABBPHx4w7DJ7PWvYOJ5w',b'2017-06-20',5,7,m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,33,"""Taliesin West""",,"""12621 N Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd""",Scottsdale,AZ,85259,33.606258,-111.845006,4.5,238,1,Arts & Entertainment;Architects;Architectural Tours;Professional Services;Hotels & Travel;Tours;Travel Services;Local Flavor;Museums
3,1477405,"b'I found out about this place in my Phoenix hotel room as I was channel surfing and landed on a show called ""Check, Please! Arizona"" where three really polite women were describing their favorite local restaurant to the semi-interested host. The funny thing is that I was on an episode of ""Check, Please! Bay Area"" several years ago where I was one of three heavily opinionated people defending our restaurant choices as the host was pounding Chardonnay. What drew me here was that it was a well-regarded vegetarian place with an Asian accent much like the excellent Veggie Village (review: http://bit.ly/2uJzEZT). Will lightning strike twice?\n\nPhoenix always surprises me with its geographic size as it took me almost an hour to get here from Peoria where I was staying. The restaurant turned out to be in the middle of a shopping center parking lot which I have noticed is a common piece of real estate for a lot of eateries here. I must have been early because I was their first customer of the evening, and it looked like the manager was still working on the books at one of the tables. As I indulgently sidled into a booth that could easily fit four, it didn\'t take me long for me to figure out what to order because it all sounded organic and healthy to me. I first tried the $5.95 Fresh Cucumber Rolls which I first saw on the show.\n\nThey rolled up fried tofu, marinated julienne white radish, carrot, and fresh mint, and vermicelli noodles, all rolled up in a thin slice of cucumber and served with a thick and delectable peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2jcfEbp). I frankly couldn\'t get enough of those. The same price Autumn and Summer Rolls appeared just as appetizing. For my entree, I ordered the $11.95 Rainbow Wonder, an abundant platter of stir-fried vegetables in seven different colors (thus the apt name) along with shiitake mushrooms, all of it mixed with a sesame-ginger garlic sauce and accompanied by brown rice (photo http://bit.ly/2AYQh42). Just perfect for a late summer meal.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...simple executions of really healthy dishes, well turned with an Asian twist\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...unsurprisingly green and more fast food-looking than expected but still quite peaceful\nSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive even if I was the only one in there\nTOTAL - 5 stars...Chef May Li has figured out an epicurean niche for her bountiful dishes and it works'",13,0nyM_mub7LxN6Dx7tYpMaA,14,b'MAYlkpDb0UB3U3GF86eBqg',b'2017-11-21',5,8,m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,33,"""Fresh Mint""",,"""13802 N Scottsdale Rd, Ste 161""",Scottsdale,AZ,85254,33.61285904,-111.9267545,4,315,1,Vegetarian;Restaurants;Vegan;Kosher
4,1288343,"b""I never even thought about coming here until I found myself with time to kill at Sky Harbor which is surprisingly nearby. The truth was that I had an early afternoon appointment to get my global entry card, but I was done with three hours until my flight home. Now I suppose I could have done work from my laptop or grazed liberally at the airport eateries. Neither option sounded attractive on a day that was boiling over to 105 degrees. I heard about this magical place from a local friend who recommended a visit, so why not? I took a short Lyft ride there and couldn't tell where the entrance was since there was nobody around.\n\nI finally figured out the entry path and took note of the $24.95 admission not knowing what was in store behind the gate. Apparently it's free the second Tuesday of every month but no matter as the admission turned out to be more than worth it if the flora and fauna is the Sonoran desert is your cup of tea. Opened in 1939, this is such a lovely 140-acre space set in the picturesque Sedona-like rock setting of Papago Park (photo: http://bit.ly/2i3Klie). Five separate trails allow you to navigate the grounds with ease, each with unique themes that frankly meld together to showcase what makes this part of the country so special.\n\nThere are over 50,000 plants on display along the walkways, though the kings are obviously the cacti and succulents that dominate the central area (photo: http://bit.ly/2yMdoyQ). They hold several events over the course of the year like Las Noches de las Luminarias where you can see over 8,000 luminaria bags at dusk during the holidays. There's also the obligatory gift shop and a surprisingly good restaurant named after the gardens' founder, Gertrude's, which I took advantage of for a late lunch. It was most definitely worth a field trip from the airport to appreciate the scope of the beauty presented here regardless of the temperature.""",8,GIhzzb9tjqLCYdNP_k3-dQ,7,b'iEIAZol_DVs2KOMQ5ANjtw',b'2017-10-25',5,3,m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,31,"""Desert Botanical Garden""",,"""1201 N Galvin Pkwy""",Tempe,AZ,85008,33.4620773,-111.9450978,4.5,763,1,Botanical Gardens;Arts & Entertainment
5,1477418,"b'Here\'s a shocker: The best pizza in Vegas is not on the Strip. Yes, I know you\'re gobsmacked, but it\'s true and Naked City Pizza is the proof. I usually don\'t pay that much attention to the Triple-D man, Guy Fieri, the man who single-handedly destroyed the Food Network, but occasionally some places he recommends are actually good. One was Broken Record back in San Francisco, but this may be his best find yet. This isn\'t the one he went to either as another Naked City Pizza, presumably the original location, is on the other side of the Strip in the back of a dive bar on Arville. Now that sounds like Triple D. Off the hook, dude.\n\nThis one is in a makeshift office building on the way to the airport which is exactly why Jamie W. and I ended up here. It wasn\'t crowded at about 5PM, just one ravenous family next to the window. The paper menu was a bit tattered, but we thought everything they offered appeared quite tempting. We decided the share the $7.50 Naked Salad, a bargain that combined iceberg lettuce, spinach, roasted sweet peppers, white onion, marinated tomato, and shredded mozzarella, all of it tossed in a housemade vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1RCNyjX). It was that tangy dressing along with the fresh ingredients that made this salad really hit the spot.\n\nBecause of the subheader description, ""Featured on Food Network\'s DDD"",  the Guinea Pie was our pizza of choice. It\'s made the old-fashioned Sicilian way in a rectangular, cookie-sheet shape with a soft, aerated dough that was quite amazing. The main topping was what they referred to as Grandma\'s Meatballs, which looked to be sliced and mixed with mint, accompanied by baby spinach leaves, heaping spoonfuls of ricotta, mozzarella and white garlic sauce. We decided to go for the $14.95 quarter sheet, which was plenty since it consisted of six hefty pieces (photo: http://bit.ly/1QoTOco). I think that dough could have handled any topping, but the white-on-white, Buffalo-style combination worked really well.

6,1477416,"b'I had never heard of this place before a Lyft driver took me from the airport to the nearby Desert Botanical Garden (review: http://bit.ly/2iTMXzG), and he was so big on this museum that he had brochures in the back pocket of the passenger seat. It must have worked because on my very next business trip to Phoenix, I decided to take a detour toward Scottsdale to find this place. It honestly looked like a sterile corporate business park upon approach, which should come as no surprise since it was founded by Robert J. Ulrich, the former CEO and Chairman of the Target Corporation. What was surprising was how cavernous this place is inside with over 6,600 musical instruments on display broken out geographically.\n\nMy 4th grade music teacher, Miss Nelson, would have loved this place since she forced me to play ""Greensleeves"" on the autoharp in front of my class. Covering over 200,000 square feet, the museum starts with an impressive gallery of guitars in a semicircular room (photo: http://bit.ly/2zWa5bE) followed by a room of musical instruments which appear to be a sneak preview of what you\'re about to see on the second floor (photo: http://bit.ly/2AEkp4q). A long escalator ride upward takes you to the Geographic Galleries where you walk through five cavernous rooms representing the major regions of the world. In each room, there are unique instruments that represent each country in that region. Yes, every country has its own section.\n\nThrough a wireless guidePORT you\'re given at the front desk, you basically walk up to any exhibit with a video running, and you can listen to that performance as you approach it because the headphones are activated automatically. Needless to say, you should take your time perusing these rooms because each exhibit provides a fascinating insight into that country\'s culture (photo: http://bit.ly/2icRWM7). Despite the exotic sights and sounds found in most of the rooms, the United States/Canada gallery is the largest with special sections devoted to the electric guitar, Steinway pianos, rap, country, Hawaiian music, and even a miniature symphony orchestra in a lucite display case (photo: http://bit.ly/2yBxL0T).\n\nOnce done with the Geographic Galleries, you walk down a spiral staircase back to the first floor where you can enter the Artist Gallery. Here you find exhibits dedicated to musical icons ranging from Elvis (photo: http://bit.ly/2yBy9wn) to Carlos Santana (photo: http://bit.ly/2jm9R6y) to Taylor Swift. I wanted to visit the Experience Gallery, but it was closed when I visited and appeared to be focused more on kids anyway. That\'s my one minor criticism, the lack of opportunities for adults to interact with some of the more popular instruments like they allow in Seattle\'s Museum of Pop Culture (review: http://bit.ly/2lkGq5q) or LA\'s Grammy Museum (review: http://bit.ly/2mlxEVk). Regardless, this is one truly impressive collection well worth visiting if you happen to be in Phoenix.'",15,wWhq9cKLCrZHcp-ezp-hPQ,13,b'jI5X6IN925nzqSSV9mzCEQ',b'2017-11-14',5,7,m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,27,"""Musical Instrument Museum""",,"""4725 E Mayo Blvd""",Phoenix,AZ,85050,33.66752527,-111.9784432,4.5,400,1,Music Venues;Shopping;Arts & Entertainment;Art Galleries;Museums;Nightlife
7,1288349,"b""I certainly hope you still don't believe in the old wives' tale that Hoover Dam was built to harness the Colorado River to generate electricity. No, no ...sheer propaganda. We all know it was constructed to hide a giant energy cube from outer space that turns everyday vehicles into evil, murderous robots. Transformers, y'know. Of course, they were almost discovered when Superman saved the dam during a massive earthquake where he neglected to save Lois Lane. Men.\n\nHoover Dam is so ripe with cinematic possibilities that it is a must-stop if you're in this part of the country. In the depths of the Great Depression, it took hundreds of otherwise unemployable men four hard years to complete this daunting slab of concrete. They say there is enough concrete to build a two-way highway from San Francisco to New York. They say a lot of stuff like that in order to impress you, kinda like a bad match.com profile description. Not that I would know.\n\nIf you look closer at the detail, you can appreciate the art deco touches that lend a historical majesty to the structure. Before 9/11, they used to offer a great hard-hat tour that took you into the bowels of the operation, but now you'll have to mingle with the rest of us plebeians on the standard discovery tour.

Anyway, you never quite expect to find good pho in Glendale among the strip malls, but sometimes you just get plain lucky. I was down there for business (...what else?) when a new colleague of mine took me here for lunch. Little did I know he was into pho and good pho at that. It was indeed in something of a strip mall and looks to be family-run with the owner quite familiar with my colleague, a good sign. The menu was surprisingly robust, and the place was hopping during the lunch hour (photo: http://bit.ly/2ae8v6a).\n\nI decided we should share the bargain-price Goi Cuon at $3.75 for a hearty duet of spring rolls with pork and shrimp, as fresh as I've had in Little Saigon back in San Francisco and accompanied by a particularly rich peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2ae8gI7).

9,1477423,"b'Jamie W. and I had not been to Vegas in at least six years, and the last Cirque du Soleil show we caught was Beatles LOVE at the Mirage. We decided to go down on the spur of the moment last weekend and stayed at the Mandalay Bay. This hour-and-a-half show is in the third year of its run, and it is quite a sonic, often visually stimulating experience. But Jamie said it best that it isn\'t so much a ""WOW!"" as it is a ""wow"". Why? I think Cirque du Soleil is at its best when they stick to the eye-popping acrobatics that continue to be the centerpiece of their longest-running Vegas shows like O and Myst\xc3\xa8re.\n\nCross-pollinating the athletic prowess of many of the performers with the hit-laden songbook of a particular artist can get a bit trickier since I start looking for how the visuals enhance the familiar music. There is further complication in Michael Jackson\'s case because his videos were as much a part of his musical identity as the songs themselves. Sometimes the video dance moves are mimicked, other times irrelevant feats of derring-do like trapeze rotations, trampoline bouncing and unbelievably dexterous rope climbing are inserted to fill in the endless choruses.\n\nUnlike the Beatles chronological history used in LOVE, this show actually has something of a storyline where four kids somehow find themselves in Jackson\'s world (Neverland presumably) and get immersed in his music. Beyond that slim premise, it\'s one Jackson song after another, mostly his familiar hits but some more obscure album tracks, at least obscure to me like ""Stranger in Moscow"". Some were predictably choreographed like ""Beat It"", which paled against the urgency of the original video, and some didn\'t enhance the original like the overdone video anime on ""Scream"".\n\nHowever, several number truly dazzled like ""Billie Jean"" where instead of the sidewalk blocks lighting up, the dancers were in the dark lit only in rainbow colors following their sinewy forms right up the side walls. Perhaps inevitably, holograms of the real Jackson - both grown-up and as a Jackson 5 child - are used affectingly in ""Man in the Mirror"". You could hear the audible sighs when the images of Jackson dancing flickered in gold. The show is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan and don\'t mind some of the drunken rowdiness of the audience as well as the unapologetic tardiness of casino gamblers.'",18,DnV2o694nhnjuRmyR39l3Q,19,b'LjwGJJZKuxyrZqwpNR3mvQ',b'2016-02-28',4,11,m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,38,"""Cirque du Soleil - Michael Jackson One""",The Strip,"""Mandalay Bay Hotel Casino, 3950 S Las Vegas Blvd""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.0919655,-115.1730561,4,919,1,Performing Arts;Arts & Entertainment
