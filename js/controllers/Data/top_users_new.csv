I also found out they offer full-service catering. The hostesses were friendly (they put up with me) and knowledgeable.The place eventually became crowded. It was somewhat hilarious (and a little offensive) how one kid was watching a DVD at the table (who brings their kid - and their personal player - to a place like Rosemary's?). It was all the more obvious since the room was dim (relatively speaking: the tables in the front bar area were better lit). Our dining room suffered from ""mood lighting"" and would benefit from seat or table spotlights; I like to see what I'm eating. Others may argue that they don't want to see their date, so this place may be good for you!Service was outstanding. Our primary server and his assistant explained every dish (even the beer selections). Like Perrier's Le Bec-Fin, the servers were enthusiastic and placed the dishes on the table in unison. Unlike LBF, the servers didn't buzz around the table like insects.I was running on an hour of sleep, so I (wisely) refrained from having alcohol but a friend had the beer-meal pairings, which he enjoyed.A few of us ordered the chef's tasting menu ($70). Compared to typical tasting menus, the overall package was a generous size and we weren't able to finish it all. The courses which grabbed my attention (even through my sleepy stupor) were:- l'amuse bouche (I was amused)- First course: salmon tartar appetizer with watercress, caviar, crackers and a saffron sauce- Fourth course: rack of lamb with Kalamata olive mashed potatoes, fried arugula, and a rosemary bordelaise sauce (mmmmmm - quite savory and the lamb was oh-so-tender)Lackluster courses:- Second course: Panko crab boulettes with marinated cucumbers (flavorless)- Third course: Crispy skin striped bass with hushpuppies and a creole meuniere sauce (not too much flavor, and not a fan of fish)- Dessert: I don't remember the dessert - not my thing anyway.Rosemary's is 30-40 minutes from the Strip, but worth the cab ride there.

Wish I had some right now.- I'm an oyster junkie, so I had to get their oysters ($3/oyster; East, West, and Speciality oysters available) were fresh and delicious.- The Forks ($21) were a little cheesy (in both senses of the word) - smoked salmon, caviar poppers, scallion blinis. My least favorite, but still tasty.I'd stop in again for the sliders, and perhaps their entrees (my one friend enjoyed his 20 oz. Ribeye ($49), and I trust his opinion).

Inside, a Christmas tree greeted us, and holiday music played. There was enough space to handle a light crowd, yet it wasn't crowded. (It was Friday but I guess their dining room thins out around 1 o'clock?)Our server waited patiently for my cousin to finish a call (checking in every so often) before taking our orders. When I couldn't decide between the mint chicken or moo pad prigking, he convinced me to get the latter.My entree's grounded up chicken was the perfect texture, aromatic, and piping hot, and the mint was a nice touch. The chili wasn't as peppery as I preferred, a problem easily solved by the liberal application of table spices. I worried that I was given too much rice, but was proven wrong by the end of the meal.

Red Rock's luxurious facility both surprised and impressed me - there's a lot to do!This casino resort has a cornucopia of features, including a bowling alley, spa, food court, multiple restaurants, and conference center capabilities. Their hotel lobby lounge features a 32-foot long chandelier, draped by an elegant staircase. There's a few stores, and a Starbucks overlooking the lobby. The casino's decor is sharp, and the restaurants lining it mirror that theme. The nearly 3,000 slot machines can confound if you're trying to find people, so pay attention to your surroundings.We had a spacious suite near the spa, with a view of the Strip and top-notch amenities: modern decor, huge soft mattresses, a comfy couch, a widescreen plasma TV, and a convenient bottle of Patron (costs extra). Loved the bathroom, and the luxurious shower. The toilet had a phone by it, and the marble tub, a TV. Besides hearing wind whistling one morning (it was crazy windy out there), Red Rock's hotel, casino, and lounges all had a fit and finish that made our dollars feel well-spent.Hotel service was stellar. When I needed help late-night, both Tanya (at the front desk) and a bellhop assisted. When we needed a random feminine hygiene product, not only did room service stock necessities, a staffer delivered the goods to our door minutes later. When hunger hit, concierge Stephanie pointed out some nearby Thai restaurants.If you're planning on heading to the Strip, keep in mind that Red Rock is off-strip.

However, in my defense, I didn't think I was going to have time to visit the incline so I didn't do my normal pre-visit research. First of all, if you've never been here before, parking is off a side road (West Station Square Dr.) and not Carson Road (where my yelp navigation guided me). We had a very difficult time trying to find where to park and saw no directional signage. Second, I was surprised there was a cost to park, but not knowing exactly how long we would stay I chose 2 hours for $2. Next I discovered the incline also has a cost. Cost for 2 adults and one child round trip was $12.50, but I quickly discovered they only accept cash AND it had to be exact change. I rarely carry cash, so the ticket agent allowed us to ride to the top where I could use an ATM machine to get $20 ($3.50 ATM fee). We wandered around checking out the historic pictures & memorabilia on the walls as well as the views from the overlook. The rain brought heavy clouds, but the view was still beautiful. We wanted to do the self-guided tour, but it was .50 cent each and would have required I go back down to get change since the gift shop was closed. My only other option would have been to get change at one of the local businesses on Grandview Ave, but it just seemed like too much of a hassle, so we headed back down to our car. There may have been another change machine in the upper station, but I didn't notice it. On the way down we sat with a gentleman whom gave us a bit of enthusiastic history about the incline and how he uses it for work. He explained how he uses the complimentary bus transfer given by the agents at the incline to get around town and save on parking fees. That helped take away some of my annoyance knowing this was not just a tourist attraction, but actually part of working life in Pittsburgh. I didn't discover rule of exact change until I handed the ticket agent my $20 and he pointed to a change machine that gives you 18 gold $1 coins and 8 quarters. -----HISTORIC FACTSOpened - May 20, 1877 and has been in service for the last 138 years as of this review.Designed to provide easy access to the lower river from the upper farmlands that were slowly being converted to new homesites as the city began to grow in population.It closed briefly from November of 1962 to July of 1963.Originally serving Coal Hill (which changed to Mount Washington during construction). It cost $47,000 to build and was originally steam poweredIt travels @ 6 mph along a 794 foot track equaling approx. 80 seconds travel time.The elevation gain is 400 feet at a 30.5 degree grade with a passenger capacity of 18 per carFINAL THOUGHTSTypically I enjoy visiting historic sites, but I had been out all day in the rain visiting other areas of the state. I was cold, wet, tired and somewhat annoyed with the traffic trying to reach the incline. Pittsburgh's expressway system was crazy difficult to navigate and I missed my intended exist because by the time I realized it was my stop, the line of traffic was so long I would have blocked other traffic on the expressway trying to wedge my way in. So I got off at the West End Bridge exit and although the incline was in view, it took me almost 25 minutes to get there. I spent nearly 15 minutes in the off ramp line alone and another 8 minutes waiting to cross the bridge. xc2xa1Ay, caramba!There is little to do @ the incline. Still, the historic value of this site (views or no views) warrants a visit when traveling to this cool city full of interesting bridges... which anyone who follows my reviews knows I love! Take it from me, knowing before you go will provide a better experience and keep your frustration levels to a minimum.I try hard to be objective:Is this an awesome piece of working history? - AbsolutelyWould I have given another star for clearer views? - PossiblyDid the traffic and multiple fees sour my mood? - Most certainlyWould I return? - UnlikelySIDE NOTE: If you just want a great views, set your navigation to Point of View Park across from Monterey Bay Fish Grotto. Here you can find a nearby free parking space and the view is even better than the overlook @ Duquesne Incline. Or turn right out of the upper station and walk a few hundred feet. 2016/73",122,PU-CSnMYXizOS3uhr316eg,112,PhjePJsc5K4J0YC9334CJQ,2016-05-03,3,90,28,1197 W Carson St,{},"['Public Services & Government', 'Public Transportation', 'Transportation', 'Tours', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Landmarks & Historical Buildings']",Pittsburgh,"{'Monday': '5:30-0:30', 'Tuesday': '5:30-0:30', 'Friday': '5:30-0:30', 'Wednesday': '5:30-0:30', 'Thursday': '5:30-0:30', 'Sunday': '7:00-0:30', 'Saturday': '5:30-0:30'}",1,40.4398652,-80.01759799999999,Duquesne Incline,South Side,15219.0,300,4.5,PA,Richard

You're CRAZY!!!That actually may be a true statement about me, since my mother has never had me tested! But nevertheless, I did not enjoy the charred, ashy flavor of their meats (particularly the ribeye steak sandwich). I didn't add any additional toppings (which might have helped), but I wanted to taste the purity of the meat. Also, the ratio of meat to veggies was ridiculously lopsided with thick cut roasted veggies being probably 70% of the sandwich. Considering the cost of the sandwich, I would have expected more meat.  Although I liked the burger much more, I was not a fan of the hard breads they use to compliment their sandwiches. I also did not enjoy the strong flavor of the roasted potatoes and the beef empanadas were just okay. My tweenage kids took a bite and refused to eat any more of their food. They have a serious dislike for anything that has a burnt flavor and I honestly couldn't argue with them. I love a decent char, but today it was like eating cigarette butts from an ashtray. I felt so bad because I really hyped this place up to them after reading reviews and getting recommendations prior to my visit. So I took them down the street for a bowl of pho to make amends. Another visit may yield a better result, but as a first-time experience goes, the food did not live up to the hype. The restaurant itself, the decor and the staff on the other had were awesome! What an eclectic collection of humans! FINAL THOUGHTSThis place came highly recommended, which makes me dread writing this review. I definitely don't want this to be a slap in the face to all the awesome yelpers who suggested Gaucho as THEE place to visit for my one day trip to Pittsburgh, but I gotta be honest. Besides, there are so many positive reviews here that I doubt mine will even be noticed.

My kids hated the super charred flavor of their burgers and rib eye steak sandwich, so I had to quickly find an alternative eating venue to satisfy their teenage hunger. Although Gauchos is Pittsburgh's highest rated restaurant, I must admit I was not a fan, but I was not nearly as disgusted as my kids.  We ate a few bites there and decided to give Vietnam's Pho a try since we'd parked practically right in front of it anyway. Yelp reviews had the overall rating here @ 3.5 stars, so I figured I wouldn't be too disappointed. However, the lack of customers and weirdly abandoned looking entrance made me pause. The entrance looks like the lobby of an old apartment building. You then walk through more doors into another space that serves as their to-go sandwich shop before walking through yet another door into the main dining area. It was dark and totally weird with a fish tank dead smack in the middle of the room, but we were hungry and decided to give it a try anyway. So glad we did!The pho came out piping hot in a nice size bowl. I was immediately impressed that I barely saw any oil droplets on the surface. This is either an indication that they don't cook their broth using beef bones/stock or they meticulously skim the surface to give you the cleanest broth experience possible. Honestly, it may be the former! But that old familiar pho flavor I love was apparent, so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and assume they did the latter. FINAL THOUGHTSGood pho at a great price.

Fairport Harbor is not just an old historic place, but a place steeped in history. I admit I didn't think much of its appearance, but looks are deceiving. Once known as Grandon lighthouse back when it was built and also goes by the name Grand River Lighthouse.The current structure was built in 1871 at a height of 60 feet on the same grounds as the first lighthouse located here, which was completed 46 years earlier in 1825. It was decommissioned in 1925 and was dubbed ""the light that shone for a hundred years."" Fairport Harbor came to be known as sailor's town because of it's importance as a shipping gateway as well as being only one of eight ports with a lighthouse on the Great Lakes at that time.----------BLACK HISTORYHowever, history shows this lighthouse became more than just a beacon for ships, but also proved to be the last stop in the Underground Railroad movement. According to Lighthouse Friends.com, The town of Fairport Harbor was not only firmly anti-slavery, but heavily active in harbouring and assisting escaped slaves to freedom. The lighthouse was said to be used often as a hiding place as angry slave masters searched the town for runaway slaves.If you didn't know, many old slave songs were actually instructions and directions on how to escape to freedom. Although this has been widely disputed, I choose to believe it's true. How else could you unify and instruct a people who were not allowed to read or write, yet successfully navigate them across hundreds of miles to precise locations. I was proud to know this lighthouse lit the way for generations of slaves. I was equally proud to know the townspeople and ship captains risked their livelihoods for the sake of humanity, making this more than just some old lighthouse.----------There is also more than meets the eye. The flagpole on the west side of the building was actually the mast from the first iron US Navy warship named Michigan, built in 1843 and renamed Wolverine in 1905. Below the mast is an anchor used from the 1800's. The odd looking rounded green addition (also on the west side of the keepers house) was once the pilot house for the freighter Frontenac. At the base of the lighthouse is a windlass used to lift heavy objects  and emergency freighter wheel.As you survey the beautiful green surrounding landscapes and lake views, you will notice the amphitheater used for a variety of outdoor events. Also in view is the Fairport water treatment center, the mouth of the Grand River (very important to the early commerce of the region) and the Morton Salt mines. Last but not least in the far distance is the West Breakwater lighthouse; a square lighthouse that replaced the Fairport Harbor Lighthouse in 1925. The West Breakwater keeper's house is now a private residence, so we didn't bother to go view it.A stone commemorating the history of the Mormon Latter Day Saints history is located here. A portion f the sign reads: ""This is a meaningful place of comings and goings. From here, significant Latter-Day Saints missions were launched, including the first mission of the Quorum of the Twelve (1835), and also the first mission of the church to England.""FINAL THOUGHTSWe arrived before the museum was open, so we didn't get an opportunity to do the tour. Not a problem. They have plenty of historic information outside to fill your craving of knowledge. I do wish I had gotten the opportunity to climb the towers 69 stairs to the top. I would have loved to touch the interior walls that once helped so many black americans escape the brutality of slavery.

The first cool photo that caught my eye upon entering was a large (maybe 30x 40) b/w of the Hollywood Sign during the recent fire in that area.  Billows of ominous gray smoke loomed over the hill behind the sign......what a great shot.  I guess the photographer climbed up the hill and/or used a telephoto.

There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.It was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. For any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.Also, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. When we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. I personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.",25,LeuGZImVz_IG1e-SMYTSXw,26,JSpV31RU7upGMLWFGVycYw,2008-04-23,4,11,46,"Wynn Las Vegas, 3131 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste 28","{'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}, 'HasTV': True, 'CoatCheck': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'very_loud', 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'AgesAllowed': '21plus', 'Music': {'dj': True, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'Smoking': 'yes', 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': True, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'HappyHour': False, 'GoodForDancing': True, 'Alcohol': 'full_bar'}","['Nightlife', 'Bars', 'Lounges', 'Dance Clubs']",Las Vegas,"{'Tuesday': '21:00-4:00', 'Friday': '21:00-4:00', 'Wednesday': '21:00-4:00', 'Thursday': '21:00-4:00', 'Saturday': '21:00-4:00'}",0,36.124423,-115.146372,Blush Boutique Nightclub,Eastside,89109.0,202,3.5,NV,Jessica

Comfortable?!!!I'd like to see the Nike ColeHaan ""geniuses"" behind these so called comfy shoes, walk the strip in the boots from hell.Anyways - after a night full of painful foot issues, and chaotic club lines - we decided that the three Miss Yelps were in dire need of some pampering.And so after doing some Yelp research beforehand - we decided on Qua. Just like Nicole C - said - Qua Spa is the Ultimate.The treatments are a little pricey - but I've heard they're well worth it.  (Connie loved her massage). Nicole and I decided to just use the facilities. For about 40 dollars, you can get access to the dream facilities that make up Qua.For forty dollars you get access to big Romanesque indoor pools of warm (Tepidarium), hot (Caldarium) and cold water (Frigidarium), with sensual overhead rain showers.  Pure aqua bliss. You can spend all day dipping your body in each, and once your body is relaxed and revitalized by the mineral enriched waters,  you can grab the latest gossip magazine and lounge on the reclined hot stone chairs, which heat up your core - allowing for one of the best naps you'll ever take.If you're done sitting poolside, you can then head to the lounge area, to grab some fruity hot and cold teas (all teas throughout the spa are organically grown with only natural ingredients and flavors ). One thoroughly hydrated, you can wrap your robe tightly around you, as you make your way to the next heavenly phase in the adventure - the Laconium and Arctic Ice Room.The Laconium room is the sauna. It's the perfect place to clear your pores and sweat out any vodka and redbulls injested the night before.  Lying back on the wooden benches, you feel your body become lifeless, as your forehead heats up. Once throughly warmed - you head to the Arctic Room.The Arctic Ice Room has heated floors and benches where you can sit perched as you watch snow fall before you. It's soothing, and magical, and takes you back to the excitement you felt when young. Utter awe at the early signs of resh falling winter.Feeling the chill, you emerge from the brisk world  - back into Qua reality  - an amazing shower with high quality shampoo and conditioner (Qua even has a handy contraption to get the water out of your bathing suit in a matter of seconds)Feeling alive, awake, and amazing  - you slather yourself in moisturizer, brush your hair, get dressed, and leave Qua a better and healthier person.If you're going to Vegas - go big.

Carson St. in the South Side of Pittsburgh has one of the highest concentrations of bars per block in the country, and I can definitely believe it.  But while E. Carson St. itself is home to a plethora of sports-, beer-, and dive-bars as well as any combination thereof, which attract locals and tourist alike, the South Side side streets (try saying that 5 times fast...especially if you have the slightest of lisps - like me :) ) contain more than their share of hidden gems.One such bar is Jekyl & Hyde.  From the decor to the beer selection, this establishment could not be more faithful to its terrifically terrifying theme.The exterior is that of a haunted castle, complete with a [presumably] empty suit of armor guarding the front gate/door.  Once inside, you're assaulted by skeletal remains, ghoulish rubber heads, and spiderwebs on all sides.  But in a good way (especially if you're an avid Horror movie fan).A chalkboard lists upcoming events such as karaoke nights, live music (some of which I was fortunate enough to witness and was extremely impressed by), and free pool night.  The bar and tables are lined with flyers listing appropriately named specialty mixed drinks.  They also have an excellent beer selection, due largely to microbrewers' penchants for scary names for beers and J&H's proclivity to stock such beers.The night that I came (largely due to my Welsh bladder and the need to use their restroom) their bartender was attentive, fun, and easygoing. The music, both live and from the jukebox, was entertaining, but what really set this bar apart from any bar I've been to -  was its faithful following of its frightful theme. Staring around me at the assortment of people around me, my lungs slightly sore from belting out to Rock Band, my eyes itching from my brother's cigarette smoke, and my hands cold from my bottomless mug of water (which the bartender was on point at continuing to refill) - I couldn't help but sigh in perfect contentment.",24,WMTo7sdKEQKsfrbRNUHChw,23,aueIEsKYlXVqpvnkjK-9vQ,2009-01-29,4,17,35,140 S 18th St,"{'DogsAllowed': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'HasTV': True, 'CoatCheck': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'Music': {'dj': True, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': True}, 'WheelchairAccessible': False, 'BikeParking': True, 'Smoking': 'yes', 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': True, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'HappyHour': True, 'GoodForDancing': True, 'Alcohol': 'full_bar'}","['Dive Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Bars', 'Karaoke']",Pittsburgh,"{'Monday': '19:00-2:00', 'Tuesday': '19:00-2:00', 'Friday': '19:00-2:00', 'Wednesday': '19:00-2:00', 'Thursday': '19:00-2:00', 'Sunday': '19:00-2:00', 'Saturday': '19:00-2:00'}",1,40.4265787,-79.9809497,Jekyl & Hyde,South Side,15203.0,33,4.0,PA,Jessica

Our feet were tired and aching from standing in line, just to get in, so we scanned the bumpin' room immediately for a place to sit. No such luck.We tried to bust out our most impressive moves, hoping they'd help score us some room at at table, but all I got was blank stares, and since the sore balls of my feet, were not cooperating, I went outside.On a warm night, Ghost Bar is outstanding. Their outdoor elevated patio will provide a glimpse of the city which is well worth any wait. On this particular night, however, it was windy and cold -  so me, Connie, some sucking face couple, and a friendly bouncer were some of the only people daring enough to brave the weather.  But I needed a place to take off my boots, and outside was the only place with available chairs.And so I busted out my final most beautiful move at Ghost Bar thus far - the ole' ""get these suckers off my feet NOW!"" move, let the wind daggers of the night - wrangle my hair into some lovely knots, and then finally went inside to scope out the scene once more.Unlike Tao - there was room to move, but it had been a long night, and eager to rest our feet - we made like ghosts and disappeared.(we eventually found our way to Rain - where shoes were removed and full blown dance moves were unleashed on Vegas.

My facialist was so lovely and warm and she massaged love and kindness into my skin using Aveda's magical all natural products. She even did some hand and feet massaging as well. So blissful!My facial had no extractions or un-natural chemicals applied to it. It was all about nourishing the skin. It's reassuring to know that you're going to walk into a facial and come out with soft supple skin - rather than a face full of red marks and peeling.

I needed something before I could move, not to mention that all my clothes were ruined from the night before. The guy, who had put us up for the night, also out of laundry - provided some tiny running shorts, and someone  lent me some shoes (even my shoes were in horrible shape).   ""take these....just go to Primanti's - you'll be fine in a few...."" I didn't care what Primanti's was - I just wanted to die. But my friends nodded. ""Yeah jess - get dressed - we're going to go to Primanti's.""And so...reluctantly....I put on an absurd outfit in the middle of freezing winter - white legs and all, and climbed into the car to Primanti's.I kept on complaining, in between nauseousness that everyone would stare at my outfit in the middle of the winter weather. ""no Permanti's is cool - they've seen everything.""  They weren't messing around - within 20 minutes of a slowly eaten - to die for sandwich topped with french fries, fresh coleslaw, hot sauce, provolone cheese, and amazing thinly sliced turkey and Italian Bread....my stomach had settled and I was able to produce a slight smile.""no lie - this is the best sandwich I've had in awhile...I can't even taste the beer anymore.""And better yet, no one even flinched as I trudged out in my short shorts and clown shoes.

I apologize now for the rant-ish sound of this review.I was booked to fly out of Pittsburgh on the 29th on December. Giving me just enough time to pack in some sleep and errands before New Years. I'd been building up New Years for weeks now. (I do every year and I am always sorely disappointed). This year was different though. I just had a feeling.So much for feelings.When I arrived at the Pittsburgh airport - there was a crazy long line for the US Airways check-in, despite me arriving two hours ahead. The line just inched along. After nearly 40 minutes - I finally checked in. I rushed over to my gate to fly out to Las Vegas (eventually SF) Once at my gate - I was greeted with a line of about 40 angry people - waiting for news on their delayed Philadelphia flight. Everything was a mess.  Las Vegas passengers looked dazed as well. Those with questions were at the very end of the line, despite our flight leaving fairly soon. I noticed that I didn't have a seat number on my seat. I politely asked one of the airport staff walking by - what it meant. She looked at my boarding pass quickly - and shot back.""Just sit down. It means you're on the plane. Don't worry. They'll call your name later on - and let you know where you're sitting.""Ah - if only things went down like that. When they finally called to board everyone for the flight - I rushed into line. The woman checking passes - looked at mine and sent me back to my seat - saying i had to wait to get my seat assignment. I saw person and after person run up to the Las Vegas boarding area - and get on. I was beginning to get worried. What was going on?!I noticed a handful of others around me - looking just as pained. Finally around last boarding call for my flight, me and the rest of my confused posse - hurriedly assembled a line in front of the check-in desk. Frantically skimming our boarding passes for any clues on what was happening. Just as we stood at attention - an announcement came across the speaker.""The flight to Vegas is full. If you do not have a seat number,  we will not be able to accommodate you."" What?!I wasn't on stand-by. I'd bought my ticket in advance. I had come to the airport early to check in. What was going on?!I could hear expletives all around me. People were throwing jackets on the floor. We were all in the same miserable boat.Apparently US Airways had overbooked the flight by 20 people. 20 people over the limit - right around New Years. Smart. Very smart. 20 people who had bought their tickets - expecting to be back to run businesses, see family, and get ready for the New Years - were just bumped off their flight without explanation (though round-trip tickets were given out as a consolation).And so - my flight left without me - with my luggage on it.The next flight they could offer up was two days later -  - the 31st - New Years eve. My heart sank. My fabulous New Years plan was going nowhere fast. I had no luggage. No sleep. And I was sick of smelling the stale smell of airport. I was just glad to have a flight back though - so reluctantly took my new boarding passes, called my brother to pick me up, and went to his place.The day of the 31st - I woke up at 3am - to make sure I made my 7am flight. The airport was busy. Long lines - disarray. I made sure to check in early - and find my gate. Once there - I decided to err on the side of caution, make sure everything was set with my ticket. I found out  - once there - that someone had canceled my spot on my connecting flight. Great.Luckily a helpful US Airways rep was able to salvage my spot, but was just short of being helpful enough - to let me know. She just instructed me to get on the plane - saying she would sort it out. Sitting on the plane with anxious leg twitches - I manged to find a flight attendant who was willing to check on my connecting flight status. Gruffly - she told me everything would be fine.Once at Charlotte for my connecting flight - I checked in about my flight status back to SF. Turns out -  - my ticket hadn't been sorted out properly- and they needed to quickly find a new seat for me. The US Airways attendee managed to do so - but not without last moment panic.We finally boarded.Only to wait 2 1/2 hours on the plane due to plane issues.There was no movie on board. You had to pay for water. Coffee. Tea. It was one of the longest  - most sleepless flight i have ever endured. We got into San Francisco over 2 1/2 hours late.By the time I got back to San Francisco I was exhausted.I tried to party it up on New Years - but bailed at 12:15 am. Dancing on 2 hours of sleep just isn't practical - after being in air for most of the day. My legs were buckling under me.I blame you - US Airways for ruining my bullt up fabulous New Years plans.Boooo(that being said I still have high hopes for 2009)",57,QRxcIknwPV692ni_DDWEzA,43,msR-LoIFAf4SmhZzrHDS6g,2009-01-02,1,42,-14,1000 Airport Blvd,{},"['Airlines', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Transportation']",Pittsburgh,{},0,40.4956799,-80.2562685,US Airways,,15231.0,15,1.5,PA,Jessica

I stayed in what I believe was most modest accommodation they have (think they call it the ""wonderful"") and space-wise it was a little cramped. The bathroom wasn't ""sufficiently separated"" from the main room (I won't go into greater detail than that :). Also I'm not a TV person, but if I was I'd have been pissed off about where they placed the flatscreen. You can't watch TV comfortably from your bed (and it's not like there was any other place to relax in room). Staff: Fantastic. From the front desk people, to the concierge (Alyssa), to the waitresses in all of their bars and restaurants, everybody (and I do mean everybody) was really friendly and helpful. I've been to a lot of W Hotels that don't provide this level of service.Entertainment: Good. The pool is great during the day and at night turns into a decent hotspot. Not having to deal with the gianormous bouncer by flashing your room key is a nice perk. The location of the hotel is excellent, some of the bigger bars and clubs are a block away (and Scottsdale isn't known for it's walkability).

The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a ""cleaning"" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades.

And this gorgeous hotel is quite fitting for the wedding of a Yelp ""celebrity.""  My husband and I checked in late on a Friday night and the only rooms left were suites....and so we were upgraded to a magnificent suite overlooking the adult pool and Camelback Mountain.  I know, you're feeling real sorry for us right now. ;)  Our suite was HUGE with a separate living room, bathroom fit for a queen, a balcony the size of my bedroom back home, and 2 flat screen TVS.  After some fiddling with the TV we discovered they had tivo, which meant my husband could tivo the Northwestern game while we enjoyed hiking Camelback the next morning. Phew- the weather was too nice to stay inside watching TV!The resort was just as heavenly outside of our suite: an adult pool, a noisy pool for those of you with kiddies, delicious food, incredible workout facility including spinning classes, and a $32 million dollar spa.  I had thought about booking a couples massage before my trip, but my husband suggested we hold off since we've been going thru lots of dough lately. . After one look at the spa he asked me when we'd be indulging in our couples massage and I reminded him of our plan to save money.  His response ""when have you ever listened to me in the past?"" Next time I'll definitely be booking that massage, although this time I did get to enjoy a blissful shower in the spa. Gabi's wedding was absolutely perfect.  The ceremony took place on the Valencia lawn with a breathtaking view of the mountain and then we moved inside the Valencia ballroom for dinner and dancing.  The neutral colored ballroom looked lovely with the beautiful fall colored flowers Gabi chose.The suite, facilities, and wedding were worthy of a 5 star review. So why the 4 stars? The resort seemed to be a bit short staffed over the weekend and the service at the pool, restaurant and throughout the resort was very slllloooowwww.   Wait 30 minutes for an Arnold Palmer slow.

It was an incredible workout and so fast...I could hardly believe when the hour up.Nikki, the owner, taught my Sweat class and you would never know by her energy level and smile that it was 6am. At the end of the class she mentioned she would be in Chicago later this week and I got super excited that I could take her classes there. I went up to introduce myself and let her know that I lived in Chicago. Unfortunately, she wasn't traveling to Chicago to teach fitness classes, but by the time I got back to my hotel (minutes later) she had sent me a long list of her favorite workouts and instructors in the Chicago area. She's amazing! And do you know what would be even more amazing...if she opened Bodi in Chicago!!

And that something to eat at Metro Brasserie was the chicken salad sandwich served on a croissant.  Our waiter told me it was one of their more popular sandwiches. Gabi K ordered a chick pea/eggplant sandwich, while the 3rd member of our party went with the turkey/cranberry sandwich.About 20 minutes later the turkey/cranberry sandwich arrived, but there was no sign of our meals for another 15 or so minutes. Our waiter apologized profusely and said he didn't know why it was taking so long.  I was about to eat my arm by now (being on Chicago time it felt like an hour later), but we waited and waited and waited very patiently.Once our food FINALLY arrived I really enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich...especially cause it was very light on the mayo. I hate mayo...ick.  Gabi really liked her sandwich as well, although the turkey/cranberry sandwich went untouched because the 3rd member of our party was not such a fan.  At the end of the meal our waiter offered to bring us complimentary chocolate cake to make up for the wait of our food, but we declined...these hips do not need anymore chocolate cake.  Still, it was a sweet gesture.Overall It was probably more of a 3 star experience, but I""m feeling a bit generous...the Arizona sun will do that to ya!",8,atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg,8,OObHB8cqhRvYvkt_QnbOSA,2009-02-20,4,8,21,"7114 E Stetson Dr, Ste 105","{'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': True, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}}","['French', 'Restaurants']",Scottsdale,"{'Monday': '11:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Friday': '11:00-2:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-2:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-2:00'}",0,33.498915000000004,-111.92825800000001,Metro Brasserie & Bar,,85251.0,76,3.5,AZ,Andrea

Even though I was technically still on Chicago time it felt early...really early. She had signed us up for Heidi's TRX class, which isn't included in the membership ($15/person). We don't have to pay for TRX classes at my gym at home, but apparently it's a new class here. When we first checked in they told us the class was taking place on the rooftop of the gym. We headed on up and realized it was outside. Being a Chicagoan I feel silly being worried about being cold in 60 degree weather, but we did hesitate taking the class due to it being outside.  Ultimately, we decided to give it a shot and hoped Heidi would get us warmed up quickly.  Heidi did just that and within minutes I was loving the temps, not to mention the opportunity to be outside in January. Amazing!! Rumor has it Heidi is a popular instructor and I can see why. She's challenging, motivating and focused on form so you know you're actually doing the moves correctly.  If I lived in the area I'd likely sign up for this class on a weekly basis....or...maybe Heidi's classes that are a bit later in the morning. The rest of the gym was absolutely packed.

I got my ass (quite sore from my pinnacle peak hike) out of bed at 4 AM and waited for my cab service to arrive....and waited....and waited.  After 10 minutes of no cab I decided to give them a call and make sure they were on the way.  The woman who answered the phone informed me that they had canceled the cab service because they didn't have a zip code for my address? No, I had not given them a zip code (which I should add they didn't ask for), but they did have my phone # so they were quite capable of calling and asking for the zip code. And did I receive a phone call...ummm, not so much!

While I can't say I've had the opportunity to day drink in this lovely venue, I can attest that they don't do a bad job with the food + fun part.Popped in last night for a little post-work snack, and it's pretty clear that the place is a veritable who's who with enough good looking people milling about to to fill an auditorium of extras for the set of Bring It On 3 (was there even a pt. 2?). In addition to smiling 20-somethings with Adonis DNA, the food was also pretty interesting and had options for just about every type of eater (carnivorous, health conscious, vegan, et al.). Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it's much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.On a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can't imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city.

First of all, Chef James Porter is a rock star in the culinary scene in Scottsdale. He really walks the walk and talks the talk, and not because he's some up-and-coming kitchen punk with a sleeve of tattoos trying to become the next Food Network sensation, but because he's really good at what he does. If you consider yourself a foodie, he'll go toe-to-toe with you any time, and likely, he'll make you feel like a novice. With that being said, he's a pleasant guy to be around, and if you ever have a chance to share a beer with him at the bar, I highly recommend you take the time for a brief txc3xaate-xc3xa0-txc3xaate. He's quite the engaging fellow!Intriguing discourse aside, Petite Maison will leave any fan of French fare in Arizona with sense of fulfillment aprxc3xa9s fete. With an urbane, yet simple menu on their hands, their daily grit will touch on just about every aspect of what makes French dining so enjoyable. Small bites like escargots and piquant fromage dot the carte du jour, while staples like coq au vin and steak frites round out the dinner menu. Not an overly robust selection to choose from, but just the right amount to raise the eyebrows of any eater. They'll also cater to anyone with dietary restrictions (exempli gratia: vegan diners) by whipping up any assortment of seasonal, off-menu vegetable selections. In addition to the cuisine, they have a nice bar program in place with a handful of prohibition era cocktails, and a fun late night menu complete with a $5 ""red cup"" sangria chock full of fresh fruit, bathed in a crisp, sugary chardonnay. It's a steal for the taste and refreshment, and a perfect nightcap before ending the night in Scottsdale. All in all, this proved to be quite the unexpected gem in a swath of muted colors and cacti as far as the eye can see. If anyone plans on catching Giants spring training, their facility is literally 4 blocks away from Petite Maison!

It was a lifetime (and then some) ago, but my ties to the industry allowed me to take part to be amongst the first ever to step foot into the property. It had been a long 6 year wait to see this come to fruition, during a time of financial turmoil that was industry-wide as much as it was city-related. Yet, it defied the odds and at the time of its opening was as impressive as any casino resort I've ever seen.It's been nearly 7 years and multiple casino resort openings later, and somehow they have failed the capture the magic of the Cosmo. For all intents and purposes, it has done an incredible job in staying in the upper echelon of desired Strip properties and above all, relevant. All in all, this remains one of my favorite places to stay and visit in Vegas. From top to bottom, the Cosmo exudes the kind of sophistication that is emblematic in its theme, one where scintillation meets luxury, with the high-end metro vibes and modern elegance. It is a fabulous resort where even the smallest room is a suite with a terrace. The rooms are comfortable yet chic, sporting a spacious layout and refined interior. Equally impressive is their collection of establishments, ranging from haute cuisine to casual eateries. The vibe is super NYC with places like Blue Ribbon Sushi, Beauty & Essex, Scarpetta, and even STK. There are other notable names like Eggslut, Jaleo, and Estiaorio Milos, which command a higher than average price point than most nearby spots. They have their super secret pizza as well and new establishments like MomoFuku who are on the verge of opening up. Their signature in-house buffet is the Wicked Spoon, which has gone down a few notches after a sizzling debut.On the drink front, they've done well to create a very sexy line up of bars. The Chandelier is picturesque and a fun place to grab a cocktail before beginning the evening. Vesper works well as a lounge, but the ultimate is Rose.Rabbit.Lie. where speakeasy dreams come true. The Boulevard Pool is nothing home to write about, but their big time nightlife venue, Marquee, was the country's top grossing nightclub for the last couple years. Trust that the pretension is real and the upper tiered status of an Identity membership or prior relationship may be the only saving grace for a stellar time.Then there is the casino, which is dark, active, yet strangely alluring. The dealers are well dressed like any other establishment, but the cocktail waitresses look good without much reveal and everyone is uber professional.  $25 and below tables are difficult to track down on the weekends and the slot inventory is plentiful. Their comp structure is similar to the Venetian, which means big ballers here only and little else. Through it all, there is a lot to appreciate about the Cosmo. It is very much a young and vibrant casino with a crowd that embodies the very fabric of the new Vegas. Whether or not it will wither like some of our favorite spots will take some time to tell, but with the newly secured ownership as of 2014, I sense the Cosmo will remain as one of the more popular places to stay and enjoy the Sin City life.",26,5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw,18,vgWe6T5ZDIOTaU1Q6a7xXg,2017-05-03,4,11,79,3708 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'WiFi': 'free', 'GoodForKids': False}","['Hotels', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Casinos', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Arts & Entertainment']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.109746,-115.17388799999999,The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,The Strip,89109.0,3772,4.0,NV,Jando

It was and still is a very complete resort, a property with a little bit of everything. GVR recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, which in Vegas years means the novelty has worn off slightly. Despite that, it remains a great destination for all and is a great value for any stay.Similarly to Red Rock, GVR is off the strip. So off as a matter of fact, it's in Henderson (i.e. not Las Vegas). Relax I-only-stay-on-the-strip fans, it's a 10-15 minute shuttle ride at best from McCarran airport and is probably faster to get to than the Sahara, which is technically still on the strip. But like any good off strip property and especially those in Henderson, it means this joint is likely a locals casino (#1).As a hotel, GVR is definitely delivers. There are a multitude of room types, all of which are modern, contemporary, and feature some of the most comfy beds I've slept in. Everything from the regular sized rooms to the mega suites that could sleep 30, are available and for far more reasonable prices than most of the ones along Las Vegas Blvd. And at nearly 500 of them, there is plenty to choose from. I say, try to score a room near their pools - the view of the strip is nice, as is the amenities poolside.Casino enthusiasts should be able to appreciate the large casino space, which offers over 70 table games and over 2,000 gaming machines. Blackjack fans should be able to get their fill of over 30 tables dedicated to the game and poker fans will have a  decent variety of games to chose from as well. Their player rewards program is competitive, comp points from play is definitely transferrable to other Station properties. Dealers are usually quite friendly and the cigarette smoke is controlled rather well for a large space. The cocktail staff could definitely use an upgrade, but I digress.In terms of eats, there is a decent selection but the outstanding venues are a bit limited. Hank's Steaks & Martinis (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson) is the obvious winner of the bunch and then there is the pitiful TIdes Oyster Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tides-oyster-bar-henderson). I echo the pains of eating at Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-cafe-henderson) though the Feast (Around The World) Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/feast-buffet-henderson-3) has been fantastic and mediocre at varying times. It's no In-N-Out, but Fatburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fatburger-henderson-2) is gut bustingly good. Sushi + Sake (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-sake-las-vegas) is a fun time, especially for their AYCE deal. Italian joint Terra Verde (http://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-verde-henderson) is decent during lunch, though I much preferred it when Hell's Kitchen winner Rock was still running the show.GVR has a lot of random amenities, which really distinguish it from it's nearby (or far away depending on how you look at it) properties. Like the Red Rock, there is a movie theater. The Pond (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pond-henderson), is a real cool and relaxing alternative to their sick pools. A great place to catch an outdoor concert is at The Backyard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-backyard-henderson) and Ovation (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovation-henderson) is a real concert venue. Every casino has a center floor bar and in GVR's case, it's the Drop Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/drop-bar-henderson). I'd also recommend visiting the Lobby Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobby-bar-henderson) as it's probably the closest thing to a club GVR has. The property may not boast a lot of shopping, but it sits right next to The District (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-district-at-green-valley-ranch-henderson), a village of boutique and luxury stores, just perfect for those looking for an escape from the casino. It's rarely ever crowded, but then again, neither is the casino.Though GVR could probably use an upgrade on a few things, the property itself is good enough to warrant a 4.5 star rating. It's versatile, stylish, and spacious enough for all visitors. Folks who are teetering the idea of staying off the strip with almost everything at their disposal, should consider GVR as their next destination.___________(#1) This is a very, very good thing.",5,6kkxRV8H9SQLybj0xnEbMw,2,1ekmjgWn1knK55pbyH_1Kg,2012-01-08,5,2,68,2300 Paseo Verde Pkwy,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': True}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BikeParking': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Resorts', 'Hotels', 'Day Spas', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Casinos', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Event Planning & Services']",Henderson,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.020552,-115.08998400000002,Green Valley Ranch Resort & Spa,Anthem,89052.0,756,3.5,NV,Jando

The Los Angeles glam and glitz theme is perfectly executed, with the property looking its best and brightest at night.  Most folks who knew the Aladdin well are sure to be impressed at the significant upgrades from the rooms to the casino.By far the biggest changes have been in their beautiful casino, gorgeous bars / lounges, and the upgraded mall now known as the Miracle Mile (formally the Desert Passage).  Cheesy, but most definitely ""LA"" is the Extra Bar & Lounge where the show Extra is actually filmed at least once a week.  I've seen Mario Lopez doing his thing during my last few visits, I seem to forget how short he is practically every time.Without a doubt, the most impressive interior changes have been made to its casino.  The abundant tables with the chic dealers do a good job of allowing their patrons to enjoy their surroundings.  Poker players are sure to like the decent sized Poker room, however, PH doesn't run many poker events as often as they do other house rated games. I could be wrong on this, but it doesn't seem that their craps tables are rated on odds, resulting in better comps for bigger players.  Their A+ program seems to be pretty good and previous Aladdin players can resume their statuses from past play.  One thing that I wish they'd improve on is the ventilation on the casino floor, its a little too smoky on the weekends.So what's the deal with the rooms?  The larger suites and some of the standard rooms are still sporting the Aladdin decor, which are all going to be finished sometime this year.  The regular rooms (Hollywood, Deluxe, etc.) are tiny and are 400 sq ft at best.  That's solid for a Manhattan studio but not fabulous in Las Vegas.  The big suites on the other hand (Panarama, Fountain Views, Boulevard etc) are fantastic with plenty of space (1500 sq ft +) and usually sport a great view.Service all around is fairly good.  From the folks at the front desk to the executive staff running the joint to even the bartenders at the lounges, everyone has been sporting a smile without a snotty LA attitude (thank goodness this theme aspect never carried over).Since the PH takeover, the demographic for this casino property went from senior citizen level to extremely young.  There are more youngins frequenting this joint more than ever, attracted by the trendy glow of its LA theme with potential celebrity sightings given their constant publicity (Pageants, concerts, Extra airings, shows, etc.).  The younger generation could use some better nightlife, Prive is a disappointment and their lounges can get boring once the eye candy wears thin.",3,BLIJ-p5wYuAhw6Pp6mh6mw,2,1yXp7EkfmcxXOomfHxTu-g,2010-04-29,3,2,63,3667 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'WiFi': 'free', 'GoodForKids': False}","['Hotels', 'Casinos', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Arts & Entertainment']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.10968841,-115.1701429,Planet Hollywood Las Vegas Resort & Casino,The Strip,89109.0,2681,3.0,NV,Jando

Ever since its expansion of the second tower at the end of 2006, the dramatic difference can be felt in the hotel's beautiful rooms and expanded convention space.This is a locals casino destination and becoming more and more popular by the day.  Virtually everything is great here, from the food to the pool to the relaxed casino.  Nightlife is decent with plenty of eye candy over at Cherry Nightclub and the trendy restaurants within the casino are great.  Suites are spacious, well decorated, and very comfortable.  And by comfortable, I mean probably one of the best beds I've ever slept in.Few resort properties like this have impressed me to the magnitude that Red Rock has.  This place has it all and is an ideal family destination with plenty of food options (larger food court), a fabulous theater, and probably one of the best bowling alleys in Vegas.  Comped players will enjoy their stay, in addition to the visitors who are just looking for a place to get away.  As one of Vegas' most underrated properties, the Red Rock is without a doubt one of the town's best.",9,RhEvP5flF6KoPriMHmVYGg,9,xHArSOVpxZ5XdGP4sMVLUg,2008-04-25,5,4,53,11011 W Charleston Blvd,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': True}, 'WiFi': 'free', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': False, 'BikeParking': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Hotels & Travel', 'Casinos', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Hotels', 'Day Spas', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Arts & Entertainment']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.15641263,-115.3328469,Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,South Summerlin,89135.0,1424,3.5,NV,Jando

Directly behind that is good ol Caesars Palace. Of the Caesars (formally Harrah's) Entertainment chain of gambling sanctuaries, CP would likely be considered the grand daddy (i.e. flagship) of them all.Casino wise, CP has little to frown about. There are thousands of slot machines for grandma pulley and her double player cart inserts and a couple hundred tables for Daddy Warbucks and his love for roulette, pai gow, or BJ ... errr 21. It should be noted that they also feature a table or two for progressive blackjack, Caribbean stud, and even Spanish 21. A rarity indeed for most casinos that don't have these games available during all hours.The high limit area is impressive. There are a few dozen high limit slot machines with denominations of $100-500 and a vast staff for private dealers of any mainstream house game. Poker players, there's even rooms for you all as well, and they're quite pretty. No guarantee you'll receive any comps of course, best ride the coat tails of the high limit players.TotalRewards has undergone a variety of changes over the last few years. While most Diamond / 7 Star players might not have issues securing amenities at CP, know that point poolers will see a huge drop off comp worthy points. That said, the standards are higher here, so don't be surprised your baller status at nearby Bally's doesn't exactly translate to an instant reservation at Guy Savoy.The hungry will never feel that way at CP. From the laughable Augustus Cafe to the various yet random Chinese themed spots to the Mesa Gril, there is no shortage of interesting eateries throughout the resort. Guy Savoy has my allegiance, as does lunches at Bradley Ogden. Old Homestead is a classic steakhouse spot and Hyakumi actually serves a mean plate of raw fish. What I'm really looking forward to is next week's opening of Bacchanal Buffet (500+ items, 17 million to create), which has been rumored to be the next greatest all you can eat venue in the city.Shoppers are guaranteed to appreciate CP, after all, it's one of the only properties that can boast something as robust as the Forum Shops - a semi high-end mall of just about anything. It's a tourists haven, but not necessarily a trap. Locals aren't likely to purchase much here since the dollar doesn't go that far, but like all fun shopping - it's fun to look.The pools (cheesily named ""Garden of the Gods"") are actually more decent than they sound and each one has a theme / gimmick. Most of them have cabanas, but beware of paying retail for these (hello comp points!), as there are way better pool cabanas along and beyond the strip. I'm a fan of the Neptune, only because its the most social pool where you can mingle and get your splash / tan on at the same time.Beyond the usual amenities, CP boasts the Colosseum, one of the best concert venues in the city. I've seen a lot from Celine to International pop stars do their thing here. It truly is a sight and sound pumping venue to behold. The property also sports one of the largest parking structures on the strip, I've yet to NOT find a space here. If you feel like clubbin and are in an overly pretentious mood, Pure (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pure-las-vegas) might be the place for you. But a word to the wise - bottles are not only expensive here, but the service has been notoriously bad. Pretending you're a celebrity might be a better move than attempting to buy your way in.Finally, the onsite amenities are the real draw. People who are complaining of the antiquated cheesy Roman themes are probably staying in the Forum, Roman, or Palace tower. For the complete and modern contemporary version of CP's finest rooms, shoot for the Augustus, even if its a regular room. I promise it's worth it.",15,VyjyHoBg3KC5BSFRlD0ZPQ,7,JbQw6EUNUg2b42OQcHm6WA,2012-09-03,4,5,49,3570 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'WiFi': 'free', 'GoodForKids': False}","['Casinos', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Hotels', 'Event Planning & Services']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.116765,-115.174595,Caesars Palace Las Vegas Hotel & Casino,The Strip,89109.0,2393,3.0,NV,Jando

I learned of the Grotto by accident really - I was busy sipping glasses of wine and attempting to order bar food, only to learn that bar food was a delicious array of Italian fare.Perhaps it was the alcohol doing the talking for me, because everything I had was inhaled in minutes.  The Montel Wrap, a parmesan crusted Chilean sea bass married with roma tomatoes and lettuce was better drunk food than the burger and fries I was initially fantasizing about.  Another winner was the lasagna and the margherita pizza was deceivingly tasty.  I managed to go back to my hotel room in a pseudo drunken food coma, a condition best experienced in Vegas.I decided to come back during another night for dinner, this time sober and just as hungry.  Having witnessed the dining room for the first time, I realized it was easy to miss this place.  The Grotto doesn't stand out and the tacky decor wasn't going to win any awards either.  When examining a menu for a second time, it was clear Grotto's was a Italiana Americana restaurant, more than it was anything more authentic.Service was good, almost too good for a downtown casino establishment.  They were courteous, professional, and prompt with everything.  I had a stellar recommendation in the very tasty ($9) lobster bisque, not too fishy and just a tad of creme.  Another solid dish was the linguine pescatore, but felt overpriced at $27 for a medium portion.  I also was able to try their herb crusted pork loin ($25), juicy and hearty, with a nice seared crust, had a nice flavor with it.  The yukon mashed potatoes were a nice touch but tasted like they were whipped with butter and sour cream.Finally our table of hungry hippos decided it would be a good idea to order the sausage and peppers pizza.  The crust was a little charred, too much to a point where it was dry and mediocre.  I would give this another shot, especially since I've heard more former colleagues rave about this pizza than any other entree on their menu.The Golden Nugget has a mini gem here with Grotto.  For downtown standards, this is a decent and semi-reasonably priced Italian option in an area where good food is hard to find.",2,eoyvbnRYQe-z85e8Rc6vAg,3,5g48F9hwvo86qxMkisjK1w,2011-08-23,4,0,48,129 E Fremont St,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Music': {'dj': False, 'background_music': True, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'paid', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'HappyHour': True, 'GoodForDancing': False, 'BikeParking': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'CoatCheck': False, 'Smoking': 'no', 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Bars', 'Food', 'Italian', 'Pizza', 'American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Nightlife', 'Beer', 'Wine & Spirits']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '11:30-0:00', 'Tuesday': '11:30-0:00', 'Friday': '11:30-1:00', 'Wednesday': '11:30-0:00', 'Thursday': '11:30-0:00', 'Sunday': '11:30-0:00', 'Saturday': '11:30-1:00'}",1,36.170349,-115.14494599999999,Grotto Ristorante,Downtown,89101.0,425,4.0,NV,Jando

From every strike to a gutter ball, I've loved my every experience here, which is especially impressive since I'm hardly an avid bowler. This ""bowling alley"" is just one of the many reasons I can't stop gushing over the awesomeness that is the Red Rock (http://www.yelp.com/writeareview/biz/RhEvP5flF6KoPriMHmVYGg?return_url=%2Fbiz%2FRhEvP5flF6KoPriMHmVYGg).Folks who are used to divey bowling halls are in for a treat at Red Rock Lanes. The aura commands an immediate sophistication, perfect for bowlers of all levels and even the non-bowlers, proving there really is a little something here for everyone. This isn't the bowling hall that Roy Munson played in (http://www.gapintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/munson.jpg), it's the tricked out version appropriate for all ages with over 70 lanes.There is plenty of dedicated space per lane, comfy seats for big groups, and lots of tables for folks just looking to grab a bite. The catering is a tad expensive (bowling isn't exactly cheap either) but this is Summerlin, not Fremont. As with most larger bowling alleys, there is an arcade, big and extensive with most of the latest games. I only wish this place was around when I was a little kid.What put Red Rock over the top for me was their VIP bowling area. Granted I thought it was a silly (read: hilarious) take for a bowling experience, having experienced it myself I can't say enough amazing things about this segregated portion of the place. The ambient lighting was totally club worthy and the lanes are truly apart from the rest of the venue. There is something comical yet interesting about sipping cocktails and sitting on plush furniture while watching someone bowl. But to suggest that it's not fun (especially in good company) would be blasphemy.Midnight bowling after a movie in the nearby theaters is a great way to spend an evening without having to go to the strip. I've brought many bowler enthusiasts to Red Rock Lanes and many of them have arrived at the same conclusion as I:  ""This place is amazing.""",5,pQL52VHs4i3-y7zq81kFng,5,-384TwdQBUMFZLn9TFIvRA,2011-09-19,5,2,47,11011 W Charleston Blvd,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BikeParking': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Active Life', 'Bowling']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '8:00-2:00', 'Tuesday': '8:00-2:00', 'Friday': '8:00-2:00', 'Wednesday': '8:00-2:00', 'Thursday': '8:00-2:00', 'Sunday': '8:00-2:00', 'Saturday': '8:00-2:00'}",1,36.154884,-115.335654,Red Rock Lanes,South Summerlin,89135.0,146,3.5,NV,Jando

It was far away from the most popular eateries within the casino, but casual yet intimate enough to be one of the Venetian's most versatile. Good food, great ambiance, and almost always a good time.Lots of visitors to the Venetian often balk at the fact there is no dedicated buffet on premises, but if there were one, it'd be here. It won't be the self-indulgent, competitive eater training course like many other spreads at nearby resorts, but a classier, simplistic array of Italian specialties that change on a near daily basis and is served by someone every time. Be sure to ask nicely if you want a good helping and know the Sunday brunch hour is probably the most recommended time to try it.But their best execution has always been items from their nightly a la carte menu. Homemade ravioli of various fillings are no stranger to my plate and their other pasta options were filling and rich. One of their strengths was rolling with anything in the seafood realm. Whether it was a sea diver scallop appetizer or a crab ragu linguini or a lobster risotto, it would often taste as good as it looked. Prosciutto wrapped anything? Yes please.Some other tips for maximizing the experience:* Thinking of hosting a wedding reception here? Definitely a stellar choice.* Things to avoid on their menu: anything parm (especially chicken) and their steaks could use a little work.* You don't have to eat. Drink wine instead.* Service is usually super, but beware of the occasional waiter/waitress having a bad day.* Holiday buffets are nice, but avoid if you can - they're overpriced and incredibly overcrowded.* There will be live acts on occasion.

Sharing the same, luxurious theme as its neighbor, it may share a bridge and various restaurants and such, but rest assured the Encore is very much its own property.A recipient of the latest AAA 5 Diamond, it joins a very small handful of hotel establishments throughout Vegas. This basically means Encore has distinction of calling itself one of the most sophisticated, scintillating hotel properties in the world. An establishment that skimps on nothing less than decadent and showcases nothing but the finest. From its sleek exterior to its posh interior, there is no doubt this is a winner for Steve Wynn.With 63 floors, the Encore is actually marginally taller than the Wynn and features a ton of space for casino, retail, hotel, and convention purposes. Like many of the casino resorts along the strip, there is almost plenty of options in every direction though at the Encore, there is less of a need to exit in the name of seeing, eating, and doing. They really do have it all.Room accommodations are impressive from lowest standard two bed room to the ultra high end, massive suites for players. Wynn has invested so much to ensure the comfort levels in every room meet the high standards that most people have for this place. Personally, it comes down to the bed for me. I've never slept better.The casino side isn't nearly as impressive as the Wynn. There seem to be some elements of Wynn Macau here, but on a whole the ambiance of gaming isn't for me anyways, a large selling point. Boutique casinos have a way of keeping the experience intimate for particular gamblers, but the feeling here is no different than like its Palazzo rival.On the nightlife front, is there a better and more celebrated club than XS? For years, my favorite spot was La Bete, which later turned into Tryst (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tryst-nightclub-las-vegas-2) but now XS takes the cake. XS alone probably brings in more visitors than any club in Vegas and amongst the younger nightlife inspired crowd, is potentially the number one reason folks end up paying Encore a visit.Folks looking for a different eating experience will certainly find it at Sinatra (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sinatra-las-vegas) and the same goes for the clubby yet foodie ambiance of Andrea's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas). Wazuzu (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wazuzu-las-vegas) is kind of like an overpriced Asian fusion diner, which is totally skippable in the Encore experience. I personally enjoy every meal at Society Cafe Encore (http://www.yelp.com/biz/society-cafe-encore-las-vegas-5) but that's just me. The line up of eateries may not be impressive compared to its casino counterparts, but at least the places featured are quality.Lastly, I think Encore would be the ultimate property if famous Vegas performer Danny Gans were still alive today. When he was set to perform at Encore as his new home 4 years ago, he was also featured on what was at the time the largest freestanding marquee in the world. Garth Brooks is certainly no slouch, but Gans and his already bustling LV fame would've been the city's top featured act.While I don't think Encore lives up to the same standard as its bigger sister, it is still among the best on the strip for everything it offers. There is no losing scenario when it comes to staying here - it is still worth it for its location, name, and all that it has to offer.",10,Az_60nNuh1FH8Ds8oasZjw,7,lePNDagp9AyIwEGM7iUgWQ,2013-10-18,4,1,45,3131 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'WiFi': 'paid', 'GoodForKids': False}","['Resorts', 'Home & Garden', 'Casinos', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Home Decor', 'Hotels', 'Shopping', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Event Planning & Services']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.12768447,-115.16744609999999,Encore,The Strip,89109.0,1726,4.0,NV,Jando

Much like the the only 5 star hotel in Vegas, Tryst manages to keep itself above the rest of the competition for being one of the best places in Vegas to party.  With a very organized staff, excellent management, awesome decor, with an outstanding array of music and with plenty of diverse eye candy, it doesn't really get much better than this.Like all Vegas nightclubs, getting in touch with a promoter is essential.  Unless one has been in the front of the line for awhile, its the best option to get in here before the wait becomes too overwhelming.  Having a lot of girls in the group doesn't hurt either, but I digress.The club is beautiful. The posh interior is a great mix of chic with a dash of class.  Ample plush lounges surround the dance floor and the place is definitely on par with the Wynn's sophisticated theme.  Even the bathrooms which I first predicted to be disgusting and barfed up, were clean and well maintained with attendants.Getting to the bar is not difficult on some nights (like Thursday), but on the packed weekends it becomes more of a chore than anything.  The best bet would be to secure a table before hand and ordering from a cocktail waitress.  At least there is a spot to dump your stuff (if you avoid the $5.00 coat check) and someone who can bring drinks while you and your group are busting a move on the dance floor.  Just don't expect the prices to be anywhere near decent ($12+ per cocktail) but at least the drinks are strong.Dancing here is not as cramped as some other places are along the strip and the music is an excellent mix of everything from Top 40s, Hip Hop, Trance, House, Latin, and Indian music.  Typically they have an outside celebrity DJ scratching up some fresh beats and rarely does it sound like someone is just playing CDs.  Speaking of celebrities, don't be surprised at any random sightings as it is Vegas after all.  A guaranteed find is usually on a weekend night in a VIP booth that is sealed off with a red velvet and a couple of bodyguards -- which usually means they're guarding someone important.I still remember when this place was called La Bete.

Its easy to split a bottle of wine with a romantic date here as it can get incredible intimate here and with a beautiful strip view, full of lights and glamour, it makes for a very interesting proposal spot (which I'm told happens weekly here).",2,R_ZlcX46pPdjhjmfd043LA,0,gahlUsxaZZ0t4F5W7wtqkg,2007-08-23,4,0,38,2000 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'dressy', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Music': {'dj': False, 'background_music': True, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'Ambience': {'romantic': True, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'no', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'BYOB': False, 'BikeParking': False, 'Corkage': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'HappyHour': True, 'GoodForDancing': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 4, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}, 'CoatCheck': False, 'Smoking': 'no', 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'RestaurantsCounterService': True}","['Restaurants', 'Diners', 'American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Seafood', 'Bars', 'Steakhouses']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '11:00-23:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-23:00', 'Friday': '11:00-23:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-23:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-23:00', 'Sunday': '11:00-23:00', 'Saturday': '11:00-23:00'}",1,36.147408,-115.155726,Top of the World,The Strip,89104.0,1190,4.0,NV,Jando

The insatiable appetite for indulgence, the unrelenting yet ever flowing booze from all corners of the town. With the infamous Tijuana chain Tacos El Gordo in the mix, the game has now changed ... for the better. Located inside of a strip mall just around the corner of Wynn/Encore, this spot is the perfect alternative to the spendy options of late night spots mid-strip. Folks who are familiar with the Cali locations should notice the mini-spike in prices here from .15-45 cents per item. It's still a inexpensive deal on the Strip and an even cheaper / tastier option that most tacos in NYC. I digress.The late night hours from Thursday-Sunday is often their busiest times here. Lines from post-XS / Tryst crowds of drunken club goers crowd up this small spot. No sense in sprinting to Earl of Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas#hrid:rCEJrFmkm-Y5nNg1MhO7VQ) when the $10 for a sandwich translates to 4 tacos and a drink here.A true San Diegan Mexican treat - the carne asada fries ($10) are the real deal. A mile high mountain of carne asada beef, salsa, cheese, and crema over fries is terrible for anyone's diet but delicious nonetheless. Tacos of all kinds - adobados, carnitas, de cabeza, orejas, lenguas - are superb in every sense. Vegans ought to look the other way but carnivores of the Mexican loving kind will be delighted with most everything on the menu. There is no words to describe the joy of fresh, shaved, carnitas on a perfectly grilled corn tortilla with a little salsa verde, cilantro and bits of cebolla, all folded to make for a juicy, super sabrosa bite.I could go on and on about these tacos, but if there is any thing worth mentioning it's that the Downtown location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas) is even better.

For locals and I, this has remained a favorite spot for their fusionesque approach toward comfort food. Sporting a tiny parking lot and a strip mall locale, the low key vibes of KoMex immediately reminds me of places I'd see in Hawaii (the food also screams Hawaii as well). Dated interior with a homey feel, this unassuming spot has family vibes written all over it. Popular during lunch time but a real casual option in the evening, this place gets better and better each time I visit.Service gets major points for their willingness to please and the family of youngsters are always putting their game face on. They've been polite and welcoming since my first visit and do a good job despite the demand. Management has done well with keeping the food interesting and affordable. Ordering food can be a bit on the slow side, but they've prefaced this by noting the food is made with love.They've done well with the bulgolgi and I'm certain have created hardcore fans as a result of it. One could rock bulgolgi fries, bulgolgi burritos, or even the amazingly hearty bulgolgi torta. Go next level with the bulgolgi grilled cheese, bulgolgi tater tots or a traditional bulgolgi plate with rice and salad. With this meat, anything (delicious) is possible.For non-bulgolgi items, I have been enamored with their beef kimchi fried rice. Order a runny egg and take a deep breath when the yolk magically weaves everthing together. While I enjoy the spicy pork rice plate, I also love the pork belly musubi. Nachos with any of the aforementioned meats is highly recommended. Don't feel the need to dine in? Go for takeout, but I'd recommend calling in ahead of time.

There is a TV playing in the corner for the morning crowd and the staff is usually warmly greeting folks as they come in and leave. The hustle and bustle in the back kitchen becomes hard to ignore; a subtle reminder for what most people (and I) are here to eat.Their menu is practically exclusive to the quintessential American breakfast experience while featuring a decent number of other diner classics such as salads, sandwiches, and soups. I've been a sucker for hashbrowns and theirs is as good as any. Perfectly crispy, aromatic, and extremely complementary to any additional breakfast item. My last go around here was a magical plate of corned beef hash with two smooth and silky eggs over easy. I ordered a side of avocado to smear onto my toast, which was glorious in itself. Everything was so delicious, I was secretly cursing at myself knowing nothing like this exists where I live.I took my time, polished off a glass of orange juice and just marveled how simple and wonderful these foods are. Sure, I had just finished a stint on the other side of the world and was basking in the nostalgia of hashbrown glory that I was experiencing at Mr Mamas, but the food only made me think of every other time I've been here in past trips, which were all excellent.A huge shout out to the owners / management who go out of their way to make sure as customers that we feel every bit as wonderful as we did regardless of how many visits.

To suggest that the MGM folks might've outdone themselves with this one may be an understatement depending on who you're asking, but one cannot ignore the lush and contemporary flavor that the Aria brings to the city.The only property within the CityCenter umbrella with a casino is Aria. The floor is not as impressive as other nearby resorts, but is certainly no slouch with a decent array of machine and table games. Some folks may enjoy the sports book with its abundant sea of TVs and spacious seating area. Kudos to the casino marketing folks for keeping the promotions constant and a nod goes to the stellar staff of dealers and cocktail wait staff for keeping things classy.I haven't had a chance to stay in the Aria admittedly, but I am fairly familiar with their rooms, all of which are comfy, stylish, and gorgeous. The regular rooms should fare just fine for most patrons, try to score midweek room rates if you can since they're crazy pricey on the weekends (the high suites are no joke anytime during the week). Also located within the casino is a massive 3 story convention center, a major treat for those of us coming to Sin City on business. That itself is an amazing spot of the resort.If there is an attraction that makes the Aria worth checking out, it's the pool area. Not the Cirque du Soleil show (Elvis?) or sigh worthy nightlife, the pool deck is massive, containing a series of mini pools as well as one public pool.

The good ol Earl might just be the best thing that has ever happened to Planet Hollywood and for 24 hours a day, seven days a week it feeds many appetites for non-Strip prices.For those not in the know, Earl of Sandwich is a chain. Not a Nevada only chain like some others were lead to believe, but a national one. It doesn't carry the name of a Quizno's or Subway's, only its way better and until LV gets an place that is local and convenient, it seems the rest will be flocking here and adding to the already silly lines that occur randomly throughout the week.My sandwich of choice is the Full Montagu, a beautiful concoction of turkey, roast beef, lettuce, cheddar and swiss cheeses, tomatoes, and Earl's mustard. It's a classic choice, perhaps their most popular one, and it is delicious any time - whether its hungry and sober or hungover and blacked out. A fun combination is the Turkey Holiday (aka the Thanksgiving dinner), which features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and gravy. There are a multitude of sandwiches that fit every palate, every craving, and thankfully are between $5-8 each. This is considered a great deal on the Strip.If you can stomach the lines and the sometimes impatient service, Earl of Sandwich is a rite of passage for many late night hungry folks on the strip.

No, not because you're a glutton like me, but because it's simply not worth ordering a-la carte from here.

There is not much seating and the space is very open.  From the outside the place looks a very unassuming Japanese joint, lessened by the fact its connected to the casino floor.Service has been slow at times and our hostess was overly ditsy.  Finding a place for us to sit became a chore and the wait staff didn't seem that accommoodating.  Unless you have a large group, sit at the bar instead.Opting to sit at the bar allowed me to ignore most of the wait staff while interacting with the sushi chefs, all of which I'm happy to report are Japanese.  Watching them go to work on making the sushi beautiful is truly a work of art.  Our seared toro and wasabi mayo was fantastic, as was the Creamy Mango Salmon / Creamy Scallop.

It didn't have to be ""authentic,"" just a local's eatery.  I was already tired of the airport Mexican food, so instead of venturing straight there on my way out, I took a 20 minute detour to visit the city's top rated Mexican joint, none other than the infamous Carolina's.Ever have that uneasy feeling of ""I don't know about this..."" while exploring a new neighborhood?  This was exactly one of those times.  I already knew it was a dive, but I didn't know it was going to be a scene from the movies, almost as if Compton was ever smack dab in the middle of desert.  Even when we questioned our GPS directions, it never lead us astray.  Within a few minutes into a ghost town of project like homes, we found Carolina's.  There wasn't any windows, some minor graffiti, looking something like a warehouse with a bare parking lot.  The doors were painted black on an all white building, I was just waiting to open the doors to find bikers and extras from the movie From Dusk Till Dawn.Instead, I found a mix of patrons from all social classes, some waiting in line, and many sitting quietly enjoying their meal.  After a quick peak at the menu, I noticed nothing was in Spanish.  The guys behind the counter were all speaking flawless English and then I realized none of the clientele was Hispanic.  Could access to decent Mexican food be any easier?  I decided to ask the guys behind the counter for things that weren't on the menu and they jokingly retorted, ""Go to Mexico, this is Carolinas.""  The entire menu reminded me of the fast food Mexican joints (a la Muchas Gracias in Oregon) I've seen throughout the west coast, thought he prices weren't as dirt cheap as I had hoped but still a good deal nonetheless.Without abandon, I ordered a mix of enchiladas, tacos, tamales, and their infamous tortillas that were made in house.  In short, I did not come away disappointed.  The tamales were fresh, steaming away as I unwrapped the corn husks.  A quick cut into the masa revealed the fine starch hugging the bits of shredded chicken just perfectly and spiced with the perfect amount of salsa verde.  They were good enough for me to consider ordering a second one, but I was on a limited time frame.  The hard shelled taco was totally what I was used to back home - deep fried, packed, and super greasy - producing an unmistakable crunch without falling apart.  The enchiladas were drenched in a salsa roja sauce, meshed with a bed of frijoles and cheese.  This was greasy Mexican at it's finest, the kind where artery salvation was never part of the agenda, sinful with every bite.  A surprising thumbs up goes to their tortillas, simple yet hearty.  The tortillas con queso were undoubtedly cheesy and though nothing like the ones I've eaten in Mexico, were worth their weight in saturated fat.If I somehow warrant more visits to Phoenix, I can see myself coming out here for my greasy Mexican fix.  I still need to try their burritos, flautas, chimis, and tostadas.  If I like what I see and more importantly what I taste, I might be able to award this lil dive another whole star.",8,89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ,4,d0DeDB4cm2hehRlfnimS9w,2011-09-01,4,2,27,1202 E Mohave St,"{'Alcohol': 'none', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': True, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'yes_free', 'Caters': True, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': False, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': False, 'Corkage': False, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BikeParking': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'RestaurantsCounterService': True}","['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Phoenix,"{'Monday': '7:00-19:30', 'Tuesday': '7:00-19:30', 'Friday': '7:00-19:30', 'Wednesday': '7:00-19:30', 'Thursday': '7:00-19:30', 'Saturday': '7:00-18:00'}",1,33.4315556,-112.0560841,Carolina's Mexican Food,,85034.0,594,4.0,AZ,Jando

When it was first recommended to me, I expected it to be part of the Strip like any other high end eatery, and one that was in the confines of a casino resort. Instead, it is a Japanese establishment in the splendors of Chinatown.My expectations were surprisingly low the first time around. I haven't had incredible experiences of the Japanese kind in Vegas just yet, plus I was less likely to put faith in a place that was more Asian fusion than pure Japanese as Raku seems to be. And in the seediness of Chinatown no less? I was already beginning to doubt its $$$$ rating.But thankfully, my expectations were not only met but exceeded in every way. Everything was truly spectacular, from the small plates to the entrees and it was hard to pass up anything considering how fresh and tasty it all was. Stars of the initial evening were bold cuts of sashimi, namely blue fin tuna, coupled by an incredible array of tofu dishes and one dish that would make any seafood lover salivate: fresh uni with salmon roe, topped off by a perfectly poached egg.It has been several visits since then and all is right with the world. Client dinners have been nothing short of amazing and my personal escapades have resulted in a lot of experimentation with the menu. I've become enamored with a live uni udon, their daily blue crab miso soup, and their array of skewered meats.

It's a spot where there are cocktails aplenty, people to watch, and a great night time view of the Lake of Dreams. It is a relaxing place for a killer drink and is ironically one of the least pretentious venues in the entire property.For the uninitiated, Parasol Up and Parasol Down are almost two different venues. P-Up is the upstairs portion of the lounge, with comfy couches, dimmed lighting and a view of the lake from above. Downstairs is P-Down, where there is less seating near the bar but a more intimate feel all while taking in a view of the lake shows and seeing folks whisk on by. I prefer P-Down out of the two, especially if I'm drinking.The cocktails are undoubtedly pricey at $15 each, but are potent with high quality liquor and made quite well. There is some magic in the Pear-a-sol and the Venetian Spritz is a nice one to start with. Classic drinks like an Old Fashioned or a Cosmo are very tasty and strong enough to where a couple should be sufficient to get the night rolling.If you're not sure what to get, be sure to score some recs from the bartender / cocktail waitress. At the Wynn, service is paramount and P-Up / P-Down exhibits plenty of good vibes from the staff. I typically like to zone out and watch whatever performance the Lake of Dreams is having.

It remains an iconic front to Sin City, an all encompassing resort with the cheese of a gimmick theme without the sleaze of downtown. Until the hideous Imperial Palace (http://www.yelp.com/biz/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas) came into the Harrah's / Caesars family, it was the lower end of the property totem pole and often the butt of many jokes in today's contemporary resort renaissance. The corny decor, the antiquated amenities, and the lack of anything substantial in the resort sense has made it a lower end property. And that's precisely why I like it.Given its location, the Flamingo is very budget friendly in every sense of the word. The occupancy rate is likely to be high, considering its awesome low prices during the week and doable rates on the weekend. The regular rooms are comfortable and semi-spacious, not nearly as junky as early perception would lead on otherwise. There is good value in their higher end suites and in an attempt to modernize their hotel game, the GO rooms and FAB rooms will definitely surprise people with how contemporary and sophisticated they are.Barring no plans for renovation, the casino is predictably small. There are a good number of table games with a heavy emphasis on black jack (Spanish 21 is also available), various poker games, and craps + roulette. Slots, whose inventory makes up the bulk of most casinos is lacking in inventory compared to their property counterparts, but rest assured most games will be available, though perhaps *unavailable* when there are too many grannies plopping down to build on their player comps if you catch my drift. WIth regards to comps, TotalReward points are easier to apply here but accumulation will be the same anywhere.All forms of dining are going to be close to lackluster or borderline horrendous. If there is any dignity left in your palate, you'll do your best to skip any outlet of food here unless you're in a dire situation. Snobby eaters, wannabe foodies, or anyone with tastebuds aren't soon to be caught  dead eating at Hamada of Japan (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hamada-of-japan-las-vegas-2) or Paradise Garden Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas), or any of the Margaritaville, LA Subs, Johnny Rocket spots within their sad food court. Is there a worse Mexican restaurant than Carlos n' Charlies (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carlos-n-charlies-las-vegas-2) on the entire strip? When Taco Bell owns you, that's when you know there is a problem.The best thing at the Flamingo for me, is the pool. Some might call it one of the better pools on the strip and locals tend to come here more often than not. There is no elaborate nightlife centered around the pool, just good people watching, sufficient space to swim or float in, and quality pool side service for all things outdoor.And of course, for a (cheesy) photo op or children's activity, visit the Flamingos when weather appropriate. After all, like any great college or pro team, a brand is nothing without a proper mascot.",14,u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ,11,CvkmhaA-8DfTpndi1OSqqA,2012-11-19,3,8,26,3555 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'WiFi': 'paid', 'GoodForKids': False}","['Arts & Entertainment', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Hotels', 'Casinos']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.1156902,-115.1713943,Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel & Casino,The Strip,89109.0,2938,2.5,NV,Jando

Of all of the older casinos along Fremont, the Golden Nugget has renewed itself with a significant makeover earlier this year, making it one of the top casinos (if not THE top casino) in the downtown area.The casino seems slightly more expanded, with more slot machines in various areas than before.  They've also increased some of the table games load and there seems to be a good mix of games / limits for high and low rollers alike.  Comps here are far easier to achieve than any strip casino, though most players should know this.  Overall the casino staff has been accommodating, though I think the cocktail waitresses are looking a little old to be skimping around for tips.The rooms in the North and South tower are unbelievably nice, especially after the recent renovation.  Anyone who has stayed here in the last two decades will recognize the key changes made in all rooms from suites to standard deluxes.  One end has incorporated a modern, contemporary theme and the other still retains the old luxurious theme, reminiscent of a mini-Bellagio but with a much cheaper price tag.Though the general demographic here is most certainly going to be older, Gold Diggers is the only nightlife venue to attract a younger crowd.  At least the dining choices feature a good amount of variety, with the Buffet and Vic & Anthony's earning my biggest nods.If I had to stay anywhere downtown, the Golden Nugget would be my first choice.

Heydey no longer, more and more properties both new and renovated are creeping past Bally's as the decades roll along. Even then, Bally's remains a solid choice for the ever changing face of The Strip.As a part of the Caesars Entertainment family, Bally's is a part of the largest gaming corporation in the world. Total Rewards lovers can earn and spend their points here where the comps are easier to utilize than higher end properties. The casino itself is rather average by today's standards with a solid array of slot machines and just under 100 tables. I'm pleased to report Spanish 21 is available here and a beefed up a poker room is available for hold 'em lovers.The resort itself is as massive as it looks. Home to nearly 3,000 rooms, there is a good shot that there will be rooms here than a lot of the smaller places that sell out quickly. While the room rates will always fluctuate, the retail side of the hotel is reasonable for Vegas standards, especially when considering the middle of the Strip location.Hotel dwellers take note: If you're going to be situated in the North Tower, be prepared for Las Vegas circa 1995 rooms. If at all possible, try to get a Jubilee room, the equivalent of the GO series at the Flamingo. It's contemporary, modern, and a true surprise for Bally's visitors. Concierge is on point as always, a huge plus considering the grade of the resort.The best part of Bally's is also the most surprising: Major upgrades on the food front. Once considered the boring laughing stock of the local culinary scene, Bally's is now boasting one of the better steakhouses in the mid strip in Bally's Steakhouse (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ballys-steakhouse-las-vegas). Adding to the meat is their renovated buffet, the classic Sterling Brunch (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sterling-brunch-las-vegas) which has upgraded furiously not just in price ($40+ per person) but in the abundance of luxurious choices (especially on the sea food front) as well.

Gone is the sleaze of a dive club and in place is the lush, posh environment that feels like a large jazz lounge more than a strip club.  Mainstream vibes are delivered through the soft electronica beats in the background with various lit stages all over, awaiting the star performers of the night.  I've had friends come here for bachelor / bachelorette parties, with an overwhelming majority of approval from the females.

The super posh ambiance made up for it, as did the nightly crowds of locals looking to enjoy a quality drink. Bartenders were another plus here, as each had just the right amount of sass and plenty of skill in making every drink potent and delicious. And of course, there was never any cover.Digging a little deeper, it was more than simply a lounge. There was a deck, which doubled as a outside pool and a dance floor where many a DJ tore it up. The eye candy was always ambiguous, which made for people watching a fun past time in these parts. The vibe was less pretentious and certainly more laid back than most similar venues just north up the Strip.But that's all history. Whiskey Bar has been closed for some time, which is a shame.

But it never happened. Coming here 5 times - every steak was phenomenal, martinis were never anything less than tasty, the service was always impeccable, the live entertainment was consistently classy, and every experience was top notch. It should come as no surprise to anyone but it is without a doubt, Green Valley Ranch's best restaurant.It started with their 5-7 happy hour. Sitting by the bar and enjoying the piano ballads / live jazz, while sipping away with colleagues / clients on some of their killer martinis. From the dry glass to the exotic flair, I have always enjoyed their lychee and koi martinis. Every sip was smooth and the potency of the after taste made for a great finish. As one goes further into Henderson, these places just don't seem to exist.When it was evident the drinks would be taking a toll, it was on occasion, some complimentary bar food from the generous bartenders. If it wasn't drinks on the house, it was sides from the kitchen. A creamy and no frills mac and cheese, some cream spinach, an incredibly tasty lobster chowder, and a fresh, yet plump variety of shrimp with some cocktail sauce. After too many chowders / bisques, along with some of the best crab cakes in Sin City, did I finally decide to shoot for what they're known for best: Steak.I started small with a petite filet mignon, which for $40 was a bit more paltry than I had hoped. But any meat with the words ""petite"" or ""small cut"" is going to be a pricier, albeit unsatisfying portion for any serious carnivore. Instead of focusing on its size, I switched it to its taste, which was nothing less than foodgasmic. Charred bits, smooth textures, and juicy meat at its finest. I eventually moved onto to the full sized 9oz filet($46) and the prime rib New York ($45), both of which had me going gaga for more.Then there's the grand daddy. It's name is the Tomahawk Ribeye ($95) and while its a portion for two, I think I can gladly take it on by myself. It reminds me of something Tarzan or Fred Flintstone would eat - a hilarious hunk of meat on a bone, with a smell that ignites hunger for even the most casual meat eater. Paired with a gorgonzola crust ($8) and seared foie gras ($19) to add to the meal and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes, and its both a vegans worst nightmare and a glutton's finest moment.I admittedly don't visit Henderson as much as I used to, but after writing this review and an impending trip to Vegas, I think I'm due for another visit.",7,0qSKZhVC_BHPuKro4QGWJw,6,K8hcSf7WbVQBMPeOpSisQg,2012-09-27,5,3,21,2300 Paseo Verde Pkwy,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'dressy', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': True, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'no', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BikeParking': True, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 4, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}}","['Steakhouses', 'Restaurants', 'Seafood']",Henderson,"{'Monday': '17:00-22:00', 'Tuesday': '17:00-22:00', 'Friday': '17:00-23:00', 'Wednesday': '17:00-22:00', 'Thursday': '17:00-22:00', 'Sunday': '17:00-22:00', 'Saturday': '17:00-23:00'}",1,36.0209607,-115.09037,Hank's Fine Steaks,Anthem,89052.0,362,4.0,NV,Jando

No one in their right mind would ever come here for ""authentic Japanese cuisine"" but like any cheesy reality show, it's all about the experience. It is alive and well for the now Las Vegas Hotel (formally HIlton) establishment, with full on displays of in your face cooking and awe-inspiring food play (#1). For those not in the know, Benihana is a chain of faux Japanese stirfry, where folks sit around a giant grill, where a chef cooks the meal in front of the guests, serving it fresh off the grill. Due to a height in popularity and a lack of Japanese US people, it's usually a non-Japanese person doing the cooking. One thing different about this Benihana is LVH's ability to slot in actual Japanese people or Asian actors with an impossibly good Japanese accent. Either way, it keeps the facade going and the customers happy. (#2)From the tacky Japanese decor that makes me feel like I'm on a boat to the wait staff dressed in what appears to be uncomfortable kimonos, it baffles me how this is considered a ""fine dining"" restaurant for casino standards. The prices certainly match it, most of the hibachi grilled meats will run anyone from $23-32. Throw in seafood and the price nearly doubles. You know you're an expensive place when the cheapest thing offered on the menu are sushi rolls ($8-12), along with dessert.The food isn't a total fail but it's far from a total win. Sadly overpriced, it's the reality of most casino establishments any way. When in Vegas, try to let someone who had a good day in the casino take the bill, or get it comp'd off.

While the cheesiness is never ending, , this Caesars Entertainment property is as decent as they come for mid-tier properties and just so happens to be situated mid strip.The most impressive thing about Paris is their lifelike replica of the Eiffel Tower. It is haven for countless photo ops, a Strip landmark, and home to its very own restaurant (and very good) in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/biz/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas).

Not that it should be pleasing to the eye, but the casino Bar Central isn't a place where one can truly get drunk enough to spend those TotalReward points and no other bar really does the trick. Chateau as a night club hasn't been all its cracked up to be and isn't a heavy favorite in the weekend rotation of most frequented clubs at all. From a mild to medium standpoint on the casino hotness meter, Paris is somewhere inbetween.My personal favorite aspect is their rooms. Most of the standard stuff is going to look antiquated with an obvious Euro feel, but the jr suites, like the Le Mans and such have a good value to them, and the comp rewards are more applicable to higher end rooms here.

Cheap, greasy, open late at night Mexican food should practically be a god given right. Food baby seekers look no further, just about anything from Roberto's is coma inducing (food and more) , and is the promised land for Mexican munchie heaven.I heard through the grapevine (read: drunk guy waiting in line to order) that this first ever Roberto's to open in Vegas. While I can't be sure of how true that is, I am certain the place practically looks it. A total dive with a handful of tables and a counter for ordering, along with suspect odors permeating the air that make you question if that's food or just the bathroom door left ajar. I've been to much nicer Roberto's before, but the dodginess of the strip mall and shady parking lot are charming enough to keep me coming back.Be it burritos, rolled tacos, or their infamous carne asada fries, all options here are a guarantee for satiating that hunger. The wet burritos are of worthy consideration and the enchiladas are plenty saucy, not to mention cheesy. Not to be confused with rich textural Mexican platos, Roberto's is more akin to junk food 2.0 with a little Mexican flair. Beware of too much crema, the back of your pants might just start whistling.Over the years, the prices haven't changed much. Most items are in the $4-7 range unless you decide to go baller status and throw in a few camerones (shrimp) dishes which are as much as $12. Seafood isn't cheap in LV and Roberto's is no exception. Thank goodness they accept credit cards.While I can't say I would recommend the tamales (dry, a bit of YMMV), I am definitely a sucker for their breakfast burrito. It's not too big, but it's hearty enough to pass for any sub 1,000 caloric breakfast item. Eggs are usually fluffy, the meat is solid, and the spiced out potatoes give an extra kick.

It resembles almost every other Feast in the Station Casino chain, though I think the food options here might be a bit more substantial than the rest. For that reason in addition to the value, this place still gets a thumbs up from me. Like many buffets at more popular properties, Feast has taken on the concept of offering international variety through stations across its incredibly vast layout. In fact, this is the biggest Feast I've ever seen with a seemingly endless counter of options. It forces patrons to walk decent lengths to get what they want. (#1)Despite the numerous cuisines, I can't think of one that truly stands out for being outstanding. Ironically, I enjoy coming here for breakfast more than the lunch and dinner hour, but that's just me. During the weekends and holidays, the carving station is pretty impressive as is the dessert + gelato selection. Anything that requires freshly prepared stuff (omelets, pasta, shrimp, etc.) is bound to be halfway decent.Any of their American preparation is going to look something like a Thanksgiving meal (never a bad thing) and the cold foods, salad section is pretty standard. I particularly love the mini-wedge salads, they're just perfect for the bite sized salad lover. On occasion they'll feature a Mediterranean section, which is decked out in various kinds of hummus and some subpar attempts at a gyro meat.The only thing I would remove entirely would be the Asian cuisine section. I already though the pizza was an atrocity, but the entire spectrum of Asian food from Dim Sum to Sushi to sad attempts at Canto cuisine are beyond bad. The sushi cuts are terribly done, the seasoning for most of the hot food is way off. I understand the need for this though given the Asian clientele that visit Vegas on a regular basis, but I can't imagine them loving it either. All in all, the Feast Buffet can execute solid variety without making too much of a dent in the wallet. The lines can get fierce during prime hours, but having a Station players card with status might help with the wait, in addition to saving you a few dollars for each session. The food isn't memorable by any means, but it's far from the worst buffet in Vegas. ___________(#1) Laugh it up, but in the Vegas buffet world, that's exercise.",16,0WoQQlMXVIDEgI0xNdENKA,12,T2QGGlxIOx5eM44_rkVsYA,2017-04-27,4,7,18,11011 W Charleston Blvd,"{'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': True, 'brunch': True}, 'Alcohol': 'beer_and_wine', 'Caters': False, 'HasTV': False, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'WiFi': 'free', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'RestaurantsReservations': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BikeParking': True, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}}","['Restaurants', 'Buffets']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '8:00-22:00', 'Tuesday': '8:00-22:00', 'Friday': '8:00-22:00', 'Wednesday': '8:00-22:00', 'Thursday': '8:00-22:00', 'Sunday': '8:00-22:00', 'Saturday': '8:00-22:00'}",1,36.156593,-115.33276699999999,Feast Buffet,South Summerlin,89135.0,568,3.5,NV,Jando

For all of the beautiful venues The Cosmopolitan offered, The Chandelier being a bar inside of a chandelier, sounded gimmicky, tacky, and stupidly touristy. In spite of all of those things, I've had nothing but a great time for every time I've been here.There is probably nothing in the Cosmo that gives off a more pretentious vibe than the nightlife options in the resort than sipping overpriced drinks while surveying the scene. Isn't that what a lot of folks end up doing any way regardless of the venue? Might as well do it inside of a chandelier, you never know who is hiding behind those crystals. Plus, the light emanating from the various beads is a kind of a cool effect while sipping on cocktails.Speaking of cocktails, while understandably pricey, they're made with all the TLC any bar could ask for. From general mixes like an Old Fashioned or Goose Martini, try a new spin in their New Fashioned and Marsh Tini (with toasted marshmellows). A sazerac and hot mule are highly recommended, as is the lychee martini and my personal Vegas classic, the purple hooter. In between sips, some quiet conversation would be a nice touch.On the service front, be good to the waitress / cocktail server and they'll be good to you. This means not complicating your order with specific recipes, taking recommendations, and being flexible as many of the drinks are pretty atypical. If the bartender suddenly decides to be friends with you, now you've really done it.The Chandelier isn't an end all option for the evening, but a great place to start.

The half off platters of food are usually munchables and make for good finger foods while the crowd mingles away.My last go around food wise wasn't the best. The green chile enchiladas with barbacoa was bland and the meat was a bit tough to chew, but certainly overshadowed by some very dry tortillas.

Instead of wining and dining at a ritzier spot like Vic & Anthony's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vic-and-anthonys-steakhouse-las-vegas-2), I was likely here grabbing my breakfast, whether it was early in the morning or uber late at night.There aren't many eateries at the Nugget, so Carson Street is by default the typical 24/7 diner-eqse spot for all to partake when they please. The older crowd tend to order the typical choices in these parts from soups to sandwiches, pastas to salads, and virtually anything on the simple scale. For me, it was almost always breakfast.Truth be told, neither the food nor the establishment is all that exciting. Prices are a little lower here than any strip diner as it should be but the food is much less remarkable - bland and boring is the best way I can put it. At least with most of the breakfast options, they're likely to be fresher at least with eggs and hashbrowns + breakfast meat.It was easy to order a simple platter consisting of scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and hash browns.

Evidently the temptation of Japanese seafood is too powerful to resist as even I have been here on multiple occasions. Through it all, there are better Japanese AYCE spots in the city, but what it may boil down to for most is the warm comforts a chain can bring.The Miracle Mile of Planet Hollywood is no stranger to franchised storefronts, after all its the back bone of so many Vegas entities from casinos to restaurants. Where this Todai comes into play is the fact its the only Japanese branded buffet on the strip, where as anything similar is usually a hodgepodge of Asian items. Todai isn't really uniquely Japanese per se, but it is a great place to burn some moolah for a heap of food.What should come as no surprise to anyone, Todai on the strip carries a semi-hefty price tag ($35 per person), especially during their dinner hour. I personally believe if anyone is going to throw down some bucks, let it be during dinner. Their full arsenal of ""the best stuff"" is likely to be on full display.While the array of sushi rolls are visually appealing, they seem to be heavier on the rice and decorations and just a tad too skimpy with the meat. The same idea applies with the nigiri sushi. While the crab legs are plentiful in numbers, the actual legs themselves don't have a lot of substance. I'm not too hot on the hot food (pun intended), but I will shoot for the occasional baked claim, even if its loaded with mayo and crappy spices. Whenever possible, shoot for the sashimi, which includes more than just salmon and tuna, but yellowtail, white tuna, and scallops. It may not be overly fresh (just sitting on a bed of ice), but it represents the best of their raw selection and is probably the only way to get one's moneys worth without having to shovel endless food in your mouth. Unfortunately, many others will be adopting this philosophy so the sashimi inventory gets cleaned out pretty quick.While everything noted has been generic and such, the two stars really comes from a lack of quality service. Sure, its a buffet and people are really serving themselves. But the service industry in Las Vegas is regarded as one of the best in the world, especially any establishment in any of the resorts or along the strip. I understand I'm holding Todai to what might be an impossible standard - but there is no excuse for being ignored for drinks or dirty plates almost every visit here.At least their desserts rule.",5,zkhBU5qW_zCy0q4OEtIrsA,3,fA6mFXbT2_Y4yy0SPCiYiQ,2012-09-30,2,1,16,"Miracle Mile, 3663 Las Vegas Blvd S","{'Alcohol': 'beer_and_wine', 'HasTV': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'no', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BikeParking': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}}","['Japanese', 'Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '17:30-21:00', 'Tuesday': '17:30-21:00', 'Friday': '17:30-22:00', 'Wednesday': '17:30-21:00', 'Thursday': '17:30-21:00', 'Sunday': '17:30-21:00', 'Saturday': '17:30-22:00'}",0,36.10830805,-115.16816419999999,Todai Restaurant,The Strip,89109.0,324,3.5,NV,Jando

I don't feel like airing out the location completely, but try following the line of club goers on any evening to the restaurant floor of the Cosmo, where eventually they'll queue up in the hallway of records. It's not hard to find and as for the pizza, it's totally worth it.This might serve as drunk pizza for some (or most), but the quality is definitely above the subpar slices on the Strip. This pizza is airy, thin sliced, and features the kind of ingredients that make it semi-reminiscent (#1) of stuff I'd find back in New York. I was impressed with their white pizza and regular cheese pie, though I was less fond of the pepperoni and the premium ""deluxe"" option. The latter is their signature pizza, which while tasty, isn't going to win over any diehard NY pizza lovers. Sobriety will really determine a lot of the emotional responses to these slices.While it's clearly busy on the weekend nights, it's nearly dead in here during any week day afternoon. The staff and even the pizza is at its best around these times, and the secret spot is a good place to kill time over retro arcade games and the occasional drink. The lines aren't always a bad thing, but here's a pro tip: call in ahead time and just pick up the pizza later.

Exactly 20 years ago through ownership changes, it was rebranded as Harrah's - becoming the first Las Vegas property as a pseudo flagship of the now former Harrah's Entertainment (Now known as Caesars Entertainment). By ""classic Vegas"" standards, there is no shortage of history at this spot.Even though the Harrahs / Ceasars lineups and properties have changed often over the years, the same can't really be said for Harrah's Las Vegas. Compared to its more contemporary sister properties, it feels a bit 90s retro here, antiquated to the point where even the resort's amenities feel middle of the road. Call it hard times, but its likely the hotel has seen better days.Like any good Harrah's property, there are plenty of slots - approximately 1,600 of them in various denominations. Fans of 21 should find plenty of love in the tables, as there are more black jack tables than any other here (Spanish 21 is also available). They could use a few more baccarat tables (only 1?) and craps for the never ending dice fiends. As any one can guess, the casino is fairly pedestrian by mega resort standards but it has most of all the mainstream games. For you players out there, expect decent comps for the dollar and it goes a long way hereDon't expect to be wow'd on the hotel side. Regular rooms of a king or two queen beds aren't going to be all that contemporary and the high end suites are a bit on the limited side, but feature decent amenities for the price. Speaking of prices, they're usually on the lower end for a strip property, but because of the location expect this hotel to be filled quickly.Nightlife? Let's not go there. But if you might crave the firewater, get your drink on at Carnaval (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carnaval-court-bar-and-grill-las-vegas) where its likely to be  Jersey Shore, west coast edition. If you seek something different, try the Piano Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-piano-bar-at-harrahs-las-vegas) where you can see some folks throw down tickling ivory style (a la Jay Chou? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-FdX1D5hVg) while getting your drink on.Harrah's is more of a family property complete with an arcade for the kids, a wedding chapel for the love birds, a decent swimming pool for the ray catchers and cabana choir, an overpriced healthclub and spa, and convention space for the business folks who wished they were at Caesars Palace instead.Eateries are the worst offenders for me here. Don't get me started on the Flavors Buffet or the embarrassing Toby Keith Restaurant (""I Love This Bar and Grill""). Ming's Table (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mings-table-las-vegas) really belongs at Imperial Palace and Winning Streaks Grill is beyond cheesy. I think The Range (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-range-steakhouse-las-vegas) might be the most decent spot to grab a quality meal, but since its a steak house its going to be priciest establishment in the house.

In an effort to enjoy all that the city has to offer, I found myself here at Chang's one recent weekend afternoon, with the hope of scoring something delicious. What I had found was what I expected all along: an average run of the mill ""yum cha"" experience.It's not entirely their fault, after all Las Vegas isn't overrun with a Chinatown that isn't filled with seedy adult joints and gringofied Chinese spots without the support or demand of a larger community. Hence, the exterior gives away the experience ahead of time: a semi-cheesy palatial looking front coupled with a retro sign that screams Chinese Americana from decades before.Inside the Dim Sum scene is within the typical banquet hall, with a few carts that make their rounds, usually a couple with steamed dishes and the others with more fried pastries and desserts. Once we saw the same 4 carts that approached the table and very few staffers with special dishes to give out, the experience and variety is going to be limited.Everything from the steamed to the fried was bland. My beloved shrimp dumplings (har gow) needed some serious hot sauce before I could rip them from their mini bamboo baskets, even when the rice shell is dry and falling apart. The same could be applied to the fried pork dumplings (ham sui gok), which all of its glutinous glory was puffy and thick, but unfortunately was lacking on the pork part, skimpified on the guts side. All of the rice noodle wraps / crepes (cheurng fun) all needed some sweet soy sauce help before consumption, though the same can be said about the lo mai gai, siu mai, and fish + meat ball (ngau yuk yuen / lang yu kau).A surprisingly decent dish? The stir fried rice noodle with sesame seed. Soaked in soy sauce, topped with a sprinkling of sesame seed and peppers, it was surprisingly flavorful and light. It was fragrant and the texture was silky smooth. It piques my curiosity for their other non-cart noodle dishes. To no one's surprise, it falls in the special price column on the Dim Sum receipt.",3,OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw,2,ucsHV-DnazGooj4DlO7-pQ,2013-05-02,3,2,14,4670 S Decatur Blvd,"{'Alcohol': 'beer_and_wine', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}, 'Open24Hours': False, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'yes_corkage', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'free', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'Corkage': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'DogsAllowed': False, 'BikeParking': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': True}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}}","['Chinese', 'Restaurants', 'Seafood', 'Diners', 'Cantonese', 'Dim Sum']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '10:30-22:00', 'Tuesday': '10:30-22:00', 'Friday': '10:30-22:00', 'Wednesday': '10:30-22:00', 'Thursday': '10:30-22:00', 'Sunday': '10:30-22:00', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:00'}",1,36.105081,-115.20763999999998,Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine,,89103.0,498,3.5,NV,Jando

It could be the anticipation of being in Las Vegas, but alas its probably the airport and its amazing unique ambiance.  Its neither an aesthetically pleasing airport nor large enough but somehow it just happens to work for all of those who fly in here.  The baggage claim area is small for large airport standards and the ""renovations"" that have been taking place since 2003 don't seem to be even close to finished.  However, with what they have finished, looks very nice with the airtrain that has been completed to go from terminal to terminal.  Yet, there is a charm about the airport in which brings a smile to my face each time.  Is it the fact I see the LV strip in plane view (mind the pun)?  Is it all of the escorts surrounding the airport like cops on a drug bust?  Could it be the trashy tourists mixing in with the ultra rich ones?

The Riv has its time in the sun, but in the ever changing climate of sin city and the desert that hosts it, nothing is forever.For one of the non-mega casino umbrella properties (i.e. non-Caesars / MGM / etc.), it is one of Vegas longest surviving casinos. For the last 50 years the Riviera graced the north part of the strip with its over the top scintillating star theme, having been in and out of bankruptcy from the very moment it was erected. Personally, I'm surprised that it even lasted this long.For serious players, gambling here was more about nostalgia than it was about earning the comp dollar. The casino itself was understandably dated and the cheesy factor was evident throughout the property. For what it's worth, it felt more fun to play here than be surrounded by a whole 'nother crowd in Downtown, but at some point the Riviera was practically a senior citizen home.The rooms were never fancy, even the higher end suites would be trumped by low grade suites of mid tier properties. But with a lesser association, this means getting comps was no big deal. Even from a retail stance, getting a room here for $50 and under during the week was a relatively frequent reality.I wish I were around the years when Liberace was a headliner here. To go from him to Crazy Girls (a pseudo ""risque"" nudie show) seems like a desperate transition for attention.

I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.The biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like ... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.In the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm.

Le Cafe is somewhere in the middle of the diner spectrum, neither exceptional nor completely downtrodden, offering a typical menu of American food and faux-French food.Something I always found decent was their breakfast food. Sausage links, tasty omelettes, and hash browns was a meal they could whip up quickly and rather decently. Some of their sandwiches (namely the French dip) were passable for a solid lunch time option and some of the usual baked pastries that were done daily.Having sampled lots of baguette combos, crepes, French onion soup, I just avoid the French items on their menu completely. Most all I've had were mediocre, uninspiring, and overpriced. This is no surprise for any casino cafe / diner establishment, but it's like going to a Japanese place only to find out the burger tastes better than soba / udon / ramen. As a result, some of my colleagues during my time here would commonly refer to this place as, ""Le Crap.""But I am not much of a hater. Paris already is plagued with subpar eateries and most of them are closed before 11pm, which leaves the late night goers few options to enjoy.

Little did I know, they also have quite a few Waffle Houses throughout the greater Phoenix area.Admittedly, I hadn't seen Waffle Houses this far west, let alone in desert climate. Being that I was also traveling with two west coast friends who hadn't (ever) had Waffle House, suddenly  the desire for greasy, cheap food was appealing - not just for the sake of folks who hadn't had it, but also because we could say we had Waffle House in Arizona.Walking into the place, it was evident we were in the right company, as the place was crawling with people from Auburn University. The BCS National Championship (#2) brought out many of the orange and navy faithful out west, only to go for a reminder of home in the Waffle House. For a hot minute I felt like I was in Auburn, AL.The look and feel of this Waffle House was on par with virtually every other experience I've had: the molasses speed of the service, the grittiness of the interior with the smell of grease in the air, the ghastly bathrooms, and Southern patrons. The prices felt a tad higher, but I imagine they just creep up the further west one goes (#3).In the end, it comes down to the food. Waffle House is a destination for those who seek greasy food at cheapo prices during all hours of the day/night. Yet, for throughout our meal, most of the food was just bland. My biscuits and gravy were definitely lacking seasoning and my beloved hash browns were surprisingly on the bland side. I could tell my friends were scurrying along with their meal of grits and raisin toast and hardly raving about their food.One could blame it on the fact I was in Arizona, but it still is technically the South (west).

Nowadays it's become dated, a ""classic"" Vegas establishment in hotel speak, and is a destination for nostalgia seekers, folks visiting the Las Vegas Convention Center next door, or simply people who are looking for a deal off the strip.As a hotel, the LV Hilton is more than adequate. Standard rooms are all oversized and the beds are solid. While the rooms may feel somewhat antiquated for some folks, they've done a decent job of attempting to modernize the themes, though there is always more work to be done. The suite selection isn't as vast as some off strip properties, but there is some opportunity to enjoy a quality amenities, especially in the villa suites which feature a space as large as 13,000 square feet. If Hilton heiress Paris were to stay the night, I have no doubt those rooms would be her *only* choice.The casino here is a total flashback to the early 1980s. They do have a decent and more recently expanded sports book, but most of everything from their table layouts to the slot machines scream old school more than anything. Their player's club program doesn't have much sell for casino offers and even the multi-tiered program isn't much of an incentive when the amenities simply aren't enough to match the nearby competing casinos. But in the same token, the comp rules are less stringent and the casino staff is accommodating and friendly.My biggest beef with the property is their awful dining options. When their ""high end"" selection includes the dreadful Benihana (http://www.yelp.com/biz/benihana-las-vegas) or the laughable Asian fusionesque Garden of the Dragon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/garden-of-the-dragon-las-vegas), it's easy to take issue with the rest. The classic buffet served here is a real sight to behold, with bland food being managed by a real unmotivated bunch of service staff. Instead of the confusing options, I will see on occasion a crowd of tourists over at the Pizza Hut Express (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-cafe-las-vegas), but I suppose even they know what's up here. It's real sad when I'll opt for the Paradise Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-cafe-las-vegas) before throwing any additional money or wasting comp dollars on any of the aforementioned establishments. Though nightlife plays an important role at most casinos, this isn't much of a strong suit with the Hilton.

But this is a happenin place on the weekend, though albeit a tad touristy, typically featuring an older crowd that are trying to get their dance on. They don't usually discriminate too often, hence the crowd is usually fairly diverse. The place is bigger than it looks and is reasonably clean, which is a plus for any club in Vegas.The music is usually a DJ spun fiasco, composed of hip hop and top 40 hits. If people aren't drinking, they're usually dancing at Gold Diggers. Even though it's open late, their busiest times are usually toward the beginning of the night. The drinks pack their own punch due to a good pour from the bartenders, but feel spendy in this part of town.And usually the bartenders do a stand up job at keeping the crowd at bay from going over board.

Brighter and more contemporary than its uglier predecessor, The Quad also features more beefed up table and slot options than ever before, with quite a few dedicated to black jack (cheap minimums as well!). Even the dealers are friendlier, which is always a huge bonus. It has become the most attractive feature at the resort.Food options are pretty minimal as the property itself isn't very big, but the explosion of Hash House A Go Go (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5) is one of the only reasons I ever come here.

The rooms of which I got to check out were not only dated, but borderline filthy. It's as if Imperial Palace never left. The antiquated decor, the strange odors emanating from the room, and the random floor, wall, and bathroom stains are enough to scare any potential visitor away.

For nearly $16, a combination of ribs + any meat can be had (I chose the sausage).  The problem is, it lacks flavor and is completely bland.  This goes the same for the other items we ordered, like the turkey fingers, and the Shrimp Diablo, a fancy appetizer with a lackluster kick.  Hey, at least the cornbread is free.Looks are so deceiving.  This place is spacious and rather well decorated, the drinks are strong, and the food actually looked relatively decent.  I was fooled into thinking the Red Rock had struck a slight gold mine by offering a BBQ joint that many other competing casinos failed to have.

Even 4 years after its inception, it can still be debated on whether the turmoil that lead to erecting this massive collection of properties was worth it.There were a number of issues, which could directly be attributed to timing, bad management, and financial handling that kept delayed construction and its eventual opening in 2009. For instance, 6 people died in the construction of the site, prompting a strike from the workers who were concerned for their safety after working on the project for what was then a non-stop 24 hour schedule. Then there was the 2008 world recession, which left a virtual hole in the Strip, leading to a major decline in tourism and money for the city. Delays ensued when the Dubai folks decided to sue their joint venture partners MGM for a breach of contract. Let's not forget that after it opened, it failed to land much fanfare for almost two years the rash (pun intended) of sunburning incidents due to the construction of the Vdara reflecting beams from the sun? After initial estimates of 4 billion to complete the project, the subsequent total cost was more than double, at a cool 9 billion dollars.There is still The Harmon, a tower that was meant to be a boutique non-gaming resort that has never opened to the public. Halted after realizing there were major construction defects during the building process, it has been OK'd for demolition which is likely to happen later in the year or in 2014.Whether it was worth 9 billion or not, the general makeup of CityCenter is aesthetically pleasing. The Veer Towers (http://www.yelp.com/biz/veer-towers-las-vegas) are a nice high rise living option on the Strip to those who can afford it. In all of its sunburning glory, the Vdara (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vdara-las-vegas-2) is a pretty non-gaming hotel and the Mandarin Oriental (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mandarin-oriental-las-vegas-las-vegas) is one of the nicest resorts in the United States, let alone Las Vegas. There are eyeballs widening from all corners for Crystals (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crystals-at-citycenter-las-vegas), a mall where no limit credit cards can be happily utilized. The most well known property through the thick of it all is the ARIA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas), if not one of the better casino hotels on the south Strip, if not among the most scintillating.The CityCenter, in spite of its initial problems, provides all visitors to the Strip luxurious options to spend their time in the City of Sin. It brings out a new dimension architecturally, a flashy range of eateries, venues, and entertainment, and will hopefully live up to all the hype it has built up for itself for the better part of the last decade.",8,dcqHjnmKPDdOseYEo6SdAw,6,54Ffdt_ucV3uCZWuWjDaXQ,2013-10-26,3,3,-5,3720 S Las Vegas Blvd,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 4, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}, 'BikeParking': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Shopping Centers', 'Shopping', 'Jewelry']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '10:00-23:00', 'Tuesday': '10:00-23:00', 'Friday': '10:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '10:00-23:00', 'Thursday': '10:00-23:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-23:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-0:00'}",1,36.10788944,-115.1744628,The Shops at Crystals,The Strip,89158.0,317,3.5,NV,Jando

My hotel room had this eerie smell and when I had switched to another room, it still had some sort of a fish smell stained into the carpet.  This was something Fabreeze could never get out.  Bathrooms in the tub room were semi-disgusting and the closets always made me think there was a dead body somewhere in the walls.  The cleaning ladies told me they were aware of this, they even mentioned that nothing can be done.My friends got sick here from earlier experiences at the Emperor's Buffet, which may very well be the cheapest on the strip ($15 for adults on dinner!).

The name isn't some oxymoron gimmick to get visitors, but named after the Terrible Herst corporation, which operates gas stations in Nevada, Arizona, and California.  It truly is a stroke of irony to know that Terrible's is named after someone's gas station company and is among the most terrible in the city.The casino is very slot heavy here, with only a handful of blackjack tables, and 1 Roulette / Craps / 3 Car Poker table.  The heavy emphasis on slots (not a surprise given that Herbst Gaming is one of the largest slot operators in the state) makes this an ideal location for chain smoking senior citizens, boozing and sleeping on their chairs.  Casino staff is nice, though there seemed to be more cocktail waitresses than personnel.  At some point, it gets downright depressing to be here for longer than a few hours.Because the casino property itself is smaller, there are no fancy restaurants or any signs of nightlife here.  They've got one little cafe / diner (Bougainvillea) and a cheap buffet that I don't think I could eat at again even with a gun pointed to my head.The suites are small and the standard rooms are even smaller.  My non-smoking room was certainly a converted smoking room as the odor was completely stained into the carpet.  The claustrophobic feeling, coupled by the noise of people creeking up and down the hallway (thin walls) made for a very unpleasant stay.That's not to say that this place isn't deserving of any stars.  I'm giving it 1 and that generous 1 is due to the cheapo prices this place boasts.  Getting comp'd is not a hard thing to accomplish here, but we nearly paid more in our meals than we did for the actual room rate.  If the wallet is nearly empty, this is one of the places to be.

My expectations were extremely low but even then that was too much. The experience was beyond disappointing, so much so that I actually was turned off by the thought of additional Mexican food (#1).It should be said I tend to expect less of all airport establishments. Even McDonalds isn't the same animal when past an airport security gate. I really have nothing against the idea of Currito, which as a Chipotle lover, should mean I'm very open to fast food burritos. I do however suffer from a bit of confusion on it's name, which in Spanish means ""worker man"" or carries the sentiment of a ""blue collar"" laborer. Am I really eating a blue collar burrito?The ladies behind the counter were slow to make my Cajun Chicken (black beans, salsa, corn, rice, sour cream and some Cajun seasoning) and my friend's Buffalo Chicken (bleu cheese, buffalo sauce, celery), both of which turned out soggy and extremely unstable. Things got so bad they ended up serving my burrito on a plastic container lid instead of a plate. No napkins were given and no additional sauces were available. Worst of all, both burritos were beyond mediocre. I made a squeamish face with every bite into the burrito, the ingredients were neither fresh nor tasty, a deadly combo that will result in a buzzkill for any burrito lover. The after taste of the Cajun seasoning left a bad film in the mouth, that not even another (tasty) burrito could fix.
