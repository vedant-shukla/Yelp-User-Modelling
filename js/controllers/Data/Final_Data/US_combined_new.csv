And this gorgeous hotel is quite fitting for the wedding of a Yelp ""celebrity.""  My husband and I checked in late on a Friday night and the only rooms left were suites....and so we were upgraded to a magnificent suite overlooking the adult pool and Camelback Mountain.  I know, you're feeling real sorry for us right now. ;)  Our suite was HUGE with a separate living room, bathroom fit for a queen, a balcony the size of my bedroom back home, and 2 flat screen TVS.  After some fiddling with the TV we discovered they had tivo, which meant my husband could tivo the Northwestern game while we enjoyed hiking Camelback the next morning. Phew- the weather was too nice to stay inside watching TV!The resort was just as heavenly outside of our suite: an adult pool, a noisy pool for those of you with kiddies, delicious food, incredible workout facility including spinning classes, and a $32 million dollar spa.  I had thought about booking a couples massage before my trip, but my husband suggested we hold off since we've been going thru lots of dough lately. . After one look at the spa he asked me when we'd be indulging in our couples massage and I reminded him of our plan to save money.  His response ""when have you ever listened to me in the past?"" Next time I'll definitely be booking that massage, although this time I did get to enjoy a blissful shower in the spa. Gabi's wedding was absolutely perfect.  The ceremony took place on the Valencia lawn with a breathtaking view of the mountain and then we moved inside the Valencia ballroom for dinner and dancing.  The neutral colored ballroom looked lovely with the beautiful fall colored flowers Gabi chose.The suite, facilities, and wedding were worthy of a 5 star review. So why the 4 stars? The resort seemed to be a bit short staffed over the weekend and the service at the pool, restaurant and throughout the resort was very slllloooowwww.   Wait 30 minutes for an Arnold Palmer slow.   I was surprised they didn't have more people working knowing there was a celebrity wedding there over the weekend. ;)",3,NpgOB1s1qnWBfVykqe5zpQ,4,84NT6kSXBx33zk4rIryk2w,10/20/2009,4,3,44,4949 E Lincoln Dr,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'WiFi': 'paid', 'DogsAllowed': True}","['Venues & Event Spaces', 'Food', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Beer', 'Wine & Spirits', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Hotels']",Paradise Valley,"{'Monday': '12:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '12:00-0:00', 'Friday': '12:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '12:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '12:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '12:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '12:00-0:00'}",0,33.5287694,-111.973172,Omni Montelucia Resort & Spa,,85253,213,4,AZ,Restaurant,Arizona,Andrea

Since I'm trying to be healthy I knew I should get the greens, but turning down sweet potato fries is just silly!

Gary started the meal by bringing out the popcorn bacon appetizer...can't go wrong with that combo! From there I had the chopped salad, which I've been dreaming about ever since. I opted for mine with chicken instead of smoked salmon (looking out for the little guy).

We had reservations for a party of 4 at 7:15, but our reservation time came and went while we were waiting at the bar. We probably would have waited even longer if one member of our party hadn't taken it upon himself to seat us at an empty table he spotted.  We followed his lead and took our seats at the table...and soon were greeted by a friendly waiter.  Thank goodness because after a long plane trip from Florida to Arizona I was starving!!  I soon had lots of food to alleviate the pains of hunger. We started with NoRTH's infamous zucca chips for the table, as well as a pizza.  The zucca chips were fabulous- a must while dining at NoRTH! As for my entree I ordered the scallops, which came on top of orzo.  Our waiter suggested I also add a few shrimps to the dish as well, which didn't turn out to be such a great idea because the shrimp was way overcooked. I can eat shrimp for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but these were inedible! The scallops, on the other hands, were cooked to perfection and the orzo was pretty tasty as well.  We also ordered a side of organic veggies.

While I can't say I've had the opportunity to day drink in this lovely venue, I can attest that they don't do a bad job with the food + fun part.Popped in last night for a little post-work snack, and it's pretty clear that the place is a veritable who's who with enough good looking people milling about to to fill an auditorium of extras for the set of Bring It On 3 (was there even a pt. 2?). In addition to smiling 20-somethings with Adonis DNA, the food was also pretty interesting and had options for just about every type of eater (carnivorous, health conscious, vegan, et al.). Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it's much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.On a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can't imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city.

First of all, Chef James Porter is a rock star in the culinary scene in Scottsdale. He really walks the walk and talks the talk, and not because he's some up-and-coming kitchen punk with a sleeve of tattoos trying to become the next Food Network sensation, but because he's really good at what he does. If you consider yourself a foodie, he'll go toe-to-toe with you any time, and likely, he'll make you feel like a novice. With that being said, he's a pleasant guy to be around, and if you ever have a chance to share a beer with him at the bar, I highly recommend you take the time for a brief txc3xaate-xc3xa0-txc3xaate. He's quite the engaging fellow!Intriguing discourse aside, Petite Maison will leave any fan of French fare in Arizona with sense of fulfillment aprxc3xa9s fete. With an urbane, yet simple menu on their hands, their daily grit will touch on just about every aspect of what makes French dining so enjoyable. Small bites like escargots and piquant fromage dot the carte du jour, while staples like coq au vin and steak frites round out the dinner menu. Not an overly robust selection to choose from, but just the right amount to raise the eyebrows of any eater. They'll also cater to anyone with dietary restrictions (exempli gratia: vegan diners) by whipping up any assortment of seasonal, off-menu vegetable selections. In addition to the cuisine, they have a nice bar program in place with a handful of prohibition era cocktails, and a fun late night menu complete with a $5 ""red cup"" sangria chock full of fresh fruit, bathed in a crisp, sugary chardonnay. It's a steal for the taste and refreshment, and a perfect nightcap before ending the night in Scottsdale.

It didn't have to be ""authentic,"" just a local's eatery.  I was already tired of the airport Mexican food, so instead of venturing straight there on my way out, I took a 20 minute detour to visit the city's top rated Mexican joint, none other than the infamous Carolina's.Ever have that uneasy feeling of ""I don't know about this..."" while exploring a new neighborhood?  This was exactly one of those times.  I already knew it was a dive, but I didn't know it was going to be a scene from the movies, almost as if Compton was ever smack dab in the middle of desert.  Even when we questioned our GPS directions, it never lead us astray.  Within a few minutes into a ghost town of project like homes, we found Carolina's.  There wasn't any windows, some minor graffiti, looking something like a warehouse with a bare parking lot.  The doors were painted black on an all white building, I was just waiting to open the doors to find bikers and extras from the movie From Dusk Till Dawn.Instead, I found a mix of patrons from all social classes, some waiting in line, and many sitting quietly enjoying their meal.  After a quick peak at the menu, I noticed nothing was in Spanish.  The guys behind the counter were all speaking flawless English and then I realized none of the clientele was Hispanic.  Could access to decent Mexican food be any easier?  I decided to ask the guys behind the counter for things that weren't on the menu and they jokingly retorted, ""Go to Mexico, this is Carolinas.""  The entire menu reminded me of the fast food Mexican joints (a la Muchas Gracias in Oregon) I've seen throughout the west coast, thought he prices weren't as dirt cheap as I had hoped but still a good deal nonetheless.Without abandon, I ordered a mix of enchiladas, tacos, tamales, and their infamous tortillas that were made in house.  In short, I did not come away disappointed.  The tamales were fresh, steaming away as I unwrapped the corn husks.  A quick cut into the masa revealed the fine starch hugging the bits of shredded chicken just perfectly and spiced with the perfect amount of salsa verde.  They were good enough for me to consider ordering a second one, but I was on a limited time frame.  The hard shelled taco was totally what I was used to back home - deep fried, packed, and super greasy - producing an unmistakable crunch without falling apart.  The enchiladas were drenched in a salsa roja sauce, meshed with a bed of frijoles and cheese.  This was greasy Mexican at it's finest, the kind where artery salvation was never part of the agenda, sinful with every bite.  A surprising thumbs up goes to their tortillas, simple yet hearty.  The tortillas con queso were undoubtedly cheesy and though nothing like the ones I've eaten in Mexico, were worth their weight in saturated fat.If I somehow warrant more visits to Phoenix, I can see myself coming out here for my greasy Mexican fix.  I still need to try their burritos, flautas, chimis, and tostadas.  If I like what I see and more importantly what I taste, I might be able to award this lil dive another whole star.",8,89uU51kOiQXbJHVA3C6XMQ,4,d0DeDB4cm2hehRlfnimS9w,9/1/2011,4,2,27,1202 E Mohave St,"{'Alcohol': 'none', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': True, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'yes_free', 'Caters': True, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': False, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': False, 'Corkage': False, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BikeParking': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'RestaurantsCounterService': True}","['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Phoenix,"{'Monday': '7:00-19:30', 'Tuesday': '7:00-19:30', 'Friday': '7:00-19:30', 'Wednesday': '7:00-19:30', 'Thursday': '7:00-19:30', 'Saturday': '7:00-18:00'}",1,33.4315556,-112.0560841,Carolina's Mexican Food,,85034,594,4,AZ,Restaurant,Arizona,Jando

The half off platters of food are usually munchables and make for good finger foods while the crowd mingles away.My last go around food wise wasn't the best. The green chile enchiladas with barbacoa was bland and the meat was a bit tough to chew, but certainly overshadowed by some very dry tortillas.

They often remind me of a layman's version of a Costco dog but cost nearly 4x as much. Sad to say I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, but there isn't a single dog I can recommend on the menu.I can however, digress somewhat on my experiences here, all of which included slow and lackadaisical service and were driven by the hope that each time would be better. I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.The biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like ... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.In the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm. After all, I've had a much more decent version of his hot dogs in other cities, but a little airport kiosk in a space full of commuters who are willing to pay the extra buck for (as Bourdain would coin it) ""meat in tube form"" nourishment, is not going to be making anything revolutionary anytime soon.",9,Q17zQBhfq9AKmvSmhDhjlA,7,5WN5qPqqpDzUodSFZtXuxA,9/29/2011,2,4,11,3400 Sky Harbor Blvd,"{'Alcohol': 'none', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': False, 'BYOBCorkage': 'yes_free', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': False, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': False, 'Corkage': False, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}}","['Hot Dogs', 'Restaurants']",Phoenix,{},1,33.4354656,-112.0071714,Jody Maroni's Sausage Kingdom,,85034,23,2,AZ,Restaurant,Arizona,Jando

It is instead a haven for hungry travelers, all willing to pay the marked up prices while expecting a lackluster burrito. It is true when the food is neither life changing nor cheap, but this BBG will do when the pickins are as slim as Sky Harbor Airport.More likely to be a coincidence of my flights, I seem to be around whenever there is a decent sized line of folks. Contemplating on ordering a burrito while your departing flight is boarding? Aim for the plane - BBG workers aren't going to assemble a burrito and dress it in the time that you need. Service isn't exactly bustling here and knowing the burrito is going to be subpar is going to make one why you bothered to pay $9-11 for it in the first place.Instead of ordering the usual asada burritos, my secret weapon is to try to score one of their breakfast burritos during the morning. They're cheaper, the same size, and often more fresh than others since they have to be cooked on the spot. People who aren't fans of burritos can take their chances with a taco salad, which sits inside of a shell bowl, but is largely unappealing. Finally, the quesadillas are a popular option, but they cost nearly as much as the burritos with significantly less portion.The sad part is the other options in the terminal aren't much better.

Little did I know, they also have quite a few Waffle Houses throughout the greater Phoenix area.Admittedly, I hadn't seen Waffle Houses this far west, let alone in desert climate. Being that I was also traveling with two west coast friends who hadn't (ever) had Waffle House, suddenly  the desire for greasy, cheap food was appealing - not just for the sake of folks who hadn't had it, but also because we could say we had Waffle House in Arizona.Walking into the place, it was evident we were in the right company, as the place was crawling with people from Auburn University. The BCS National Championship (#2) brought out many of the orange and navy faithful out west, only to go for a reminder of home in the Waffle House. For a hot minute I felt like I was in Auburn, AL.The look and feel of this Waffle House was on par with virtually every other experience I've had: the molasses speed of the service, the grittiness of the interior with the smell of grease in the air, the ghastly bathrooms, and Southern patrons. The prices felt a tad higher, but I imagine they just creep up the further west one goes (#3).In the end, it comes down to the food. Waffle House is a destination for those who seek greasy food at cheapo prices during all hours of the day/night. Yet, for throughout our meal, most of the food was just bland. My biscuits and gravy were definitely lacking seasoning and my beloved hash browns were surprisingly on the bland side. I could tell my friends were scurrying along with their meal of grits and raisin toast and hardly raving about their food.One could blame it on the fact I was in Arizona, but it still is technically the South (west).

It's a theme that has become all too common in my visits + layovers in AZ, and my love affair with Mexican cuisine often leaves me desperate and stupid enough to seek it all forms both good, bad, and ugly. To declare El Bravo as the best burrito option in Sky Harbor Airport would be the truth, even if it doesn't say a whole lot. For airport food, it's as pricey and as subpar as one would expect. Don't fall for the sad nachos or the depressing state of their soft tacos, burritos are definitely the way to go. If the thought of eating a small brick of a burrito doesn't appeal to you, ask them to have less rice and more protein / filling. Some folks shoot for carne asada, I am more of a chicken pollo fan myself. It's not as tough as the beef and the chicken is usually the least dry of the choicesIf you go wet enchilada style, it'll save you the trouble of wolfing it down while holding it like a slob while keeping that flour tortilla soaked and moist (oh my). This will all run one close to $10 with a drink and rice and beans, which for airport prices isn't the worst thing ever. Don't expect the staff to accommodate any picky eating habits, unless of course its simply a matter of 86'xing the veggies.Finally, the airport version of El Bravo is as expected, a watered down version from the semi-famous original (http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-bravo-phoenix) in downtown Phoenix.

Yeah, like those fries would have gotten in my mouth without my full consent. I just happened upon this sparsely decorated eatery on the Yelp app and noticed a lot of approving reviews from what looked like the skinnier Yelpers in the Valley. I don't know Phoenix at all but found myself in what they call the North-Central area of town and there it was in a quiet strip mall.Steamed chicken aficionado that I am, the funny thing was that I had been wanting Hainan chicken which would have put my vegetarian aspirations on the back burner. I have a thing for steamed poultry I can't quite explain except I must be part Singaporean or channeling someone's grandmother up the Yangtze River. As fate would have it, this place was serving as its daily special the $9.95 Mock Hainan Chicken Rice. Such joyous rapture I felt for the prospect of such a culinary creation that I didn't hesitate to order it. It was surprisingly satisfying with the faux-poultry pinch-hitting quite nicely with the cucumber slices, dipping sauces, and infused rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcE75g).I also tried the delicious $5.95 Lettuce Wraps, which mixed together sauteed and finely chopped vegan 'meat', mushrooms, water chestnuts, shredded carrot, cilantro leaves, and fried rice noodles into an appetizing filling for the generously sized iceberg lettuce leaves (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcUwXJ). In this case, it was truly indistinguishable from its carnivorous counterpart. Other dishes looked quite tempting as they passed by my table like the Hawaiian Fried Rice and the Rainbow Salad. Given what a modest operation it appears to be, I have to say this was a great veggie find in Phoenix and well worth finding on your GPS.FOOD - 5 stars...great execution of vegan dishes you would not suspect would be so tastyAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...clean and modest-looking in its decorSERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly and helpful in explaining the genesis of their dishesTOTAL - 5 stars...nice to find a healthy dining experience as good as this that won't empty your wallet",17,9IIhExGT0f6x26hTjyBbrw,9,Qxu9tD0zZmCuWTfk4SKvkA,7/18/2017,5,10,46,1255 E Northern Ave,"{'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'Alcohol': 'none', 'Caters': True, 'HasTV': False, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'quiet', 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'BikeParking': True, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}}","['Asian Fusion', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants', 'Vegetarian']",Phoenix,"{'Monday': '11:00-20:30', 'Tuesday': '11:00-20:30', 'Friday': '11:00-21:30', 'Wednesday': '11:00-20:30', 'Thursday': '11:00-20:30', 'Sunday': '11:00-20:30'}",1,33.5527294,-112.0547215,Veggie Village,,85020,171,4.5,AZ,Restaurant,Arizona,Ed

Little did I know this was the original one founded by alternative medicine guru Andrew Weil who based the menu on an ""anti-inflammatory food pyramid'. I don't know what the hell that means but that high-falutin' approach translates into a heavily vegetarian/vegan menu which was fine by me. I played it safe the first time by ordering Heirloom Tomatoes & Watermelon and Spaghetti Squash Casserole (no cheese please) and was quite satisfied (review: http://bit.ly/2zOmRJs).This time I felt a bit more audacious and first ordered the $9 Edamame Dumplings, which were surprisingly savory since they contained just dashi, white truffle oil, and Asian herbs to go along with the smashed soybeans. The meltably tasty wrappers helped add to the satisfaction of the rather soupy dish (photo: http://bit.ly/2yQGY9H). To complete my dinner, I went with the 410 Shiitake Lettuce Cups. The filling was, well, filling as it combined tofu, jicama, sambal, Thai basil, and cashew into a substantial mound of flavor easily scoopable (photo: http://bit.ly/2hiRds1). I just thought it rather odd that they presented long Romaine lettuce leaves as the wrappers as they aren't naturally grabble and cuppable like good ol' deconstructed iceberg wedges (photo: http://bit.ly/2AzWKmt).It was still tasty, but I misjudged the ratio of filling to lettuce leaf and had too much filling left. Not a bad problem because it was good all by itself, almost like a moo shu pork without the pork. Frankly all the dishes sound good here. Healthy too with a bit of an Asian accent on a lot of them like Teriyaki Quinoa and Spicy Panang Curry. The salads looked appetizing as they passed by, especially the $14 one that featured seasonal ingredients like asparagus and broccolini. The place was pretty packed for a weeknight with fit and aspiring-to-be-fit Phoenicians. No matter what end of the food pyramid I was eating, I just like what Dr. Weil has attempted to do here since the menu combines healthy and tasty in a refreshing way.FOOD - 4 stars...tasty and healthy on the same plate is always a good thingAMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious if a bit loud, even the counter allows for elbow roomSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty attentive considering the flow of diners coming in and outTOTAL - 4 stars...truly true food indeed",14,XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA,13,Xmi2MeaJhZm8noedWisfdQ,11/11/2017,4,10,37,2502 E Camelback Rd,"{'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'DogsAllowed': True, 'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'Caters': False, 'HasTV': False, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BikeParking': True, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': True, 'lot': True, 'valet': True}}","['Restaurants', 'Salad', 'American (New)', 'Vegetarian', 'Vegan']",Phoenix,"{'Monday': '11:00-21:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-21:00', 'Friday': '11:00-22:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-21:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-21:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-21:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-22:00'}",1,33.51031415,-112.0276869,True Food Kitchen,,85016,1016,4,AZ,Restaurant,Arizona,Ed

Arizona"" where three really polite women were describing their favorite local restaurant to the semi-interested host. The funny thing is that I was on an episode of ""Check, Please! Bay Area"" several years ago where I was one of three heavily opinionated people defending our restaurant choices as the host was pounding Chardonnay. What drew me here was that it was a well-regarded vegetarian place with an Asian accent much like the excellent Veggie Village (review: http://bit.ly/2uJzEZT). Will lightning strike twice?Phoenix always surprises me with its geographic size as it took me almost an hour to get here from Peoria where I was staying. The restaurant turned out to be in the middle of a shopping center parking lot which I have noticed is a common piece of real estate for a lot of eateries here. I must have been early because I was their first customer of the evening, and it looked like the manager was still working on the books at one of the tables. As I indulgently sidled into a booth that could easily fit four, it didn't take me long for me to figure out what to order because it all sounded organic and healthy to me. I first tried the $5.95 Fresh Cucumber Rolls which I first saw on the show.They rolled up fried tofu, marinated julienne white radish, carrot, and fresh mint, and vermicelli noodles, all rolled up in a thin slice of cucumber and served with a thick and delectable peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2jcfEbp). I frankly couldn't get enough of those. The same price Autumn and Summer Rolls appeared just as appetizing. For my entree, I ordered the $11.95 Rainbow Wonder, an abundant platter of stir-fried vegetables in seven different colors (thus the apt name) along with shiitake mushrooms, all of it mixed with a sesame-ginger garlic sauce and accompanied by brown rice (photo http://bit.ly/2AYQh42).

Now nearly twenty years later, I was given the task of finding a dining spot for a couple of colleagues and myself on a Monday evening. Now as you know, most fine restaurants are closed on Mondays, so for some reason, I flashed back on the Hermosa and then I recalled a restaurant scene with Whitney Houston in ""Waiting to Exhale"".Shoop, shoop...anyway, that's how I found Lon's...seriously. As we were awaiting our third colleague, we strolled around the adobe-laden grounds which still had that southwestern allure I recall. As we entered the small bar and then the dining room, we noticed the decor was upscale cowboy ranch which I couldn't make up my mind was retro-chic or just faded old-school (photo: http://bit.ly/2f4fwXI). No matter as It turned out to be Arizona Restaurant Week, so we each took advantage of the three-course dinner available for $44 (photo: http://bit.ly/2eZzFzE).It started with a cutting board full of bread of which I took extreme liberties with the tasty mini-cornbread muffins (photo: http://bit.ly/2eQv4ig). My first course was the Crab-Stuffed Squash Blossoms in which the crab was mixed liberally with an aji Amarillo aioli. It was accompanied by bits of avocado, grape tomato halves and spicy sprouts (photo: http://bit.ly/2frXa7j). Good though rather tiny in portion for even an appetizer. My entree was the hefty Dry-Aged Heritage Pork Chop served with a hash made of yams, corn, hatch chiles and a swoosh of mole (photo: http://bit.ly/2dRVfse).While the pork was tender and succulent, the hash was somewhat disappointing since it tasted rather dry considering the interesting mix of flavors. We did on a satisfying sweet note sharing a trio of desserts - the Chocolate Caramel Tart with Salted Caramel Gelato (photo: http://bit.ly/2f1fEIw), Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Mango Curd and Coconut Sorbet (photo: http://bit.ly/2dZiRGj); and Lon's Signature Cowboy Candy Bar with chili-spiced ganache and hazelnuts (photo: http://bit.ly/2emUuTW).

That was the slogan for the Beef Advisory Council way back when I was an ad agency media planner. I saw Cybill Shepherd on a commercial shoot, and she took one look at the steak on the counter, admitted she was a vegetarian, and marched to her dressing room. Gee, that has nothing to do with Fleming's, but it's funny what sticks with you all these years later when I was at a company outing in Phoenix. This was the place our CIO chose for our group dinner, a generous gesture as the dinner reflected the dishes the restaurant chain are most renowned.After taking advantage of platters of appetizers including the Sweet Chile Calamari and Bacon-Wrapped Scallops (photo: http://bit.ly/2kOAy0w), we were all seated in the private dining room. We each got samplings of two salads - the Modern Caesar with fried capers and proscuitto chips accompanied by Parmesan toast (photo: http://bit.ly/2kZSVSp), as well as the New Wedge with slab-cut bacon, blistered cherry tomatoes, and crumbled gorgonzola cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/2ksZyJz). Both were quite satisfying with the wedge a nice translation of the steakhouse staple. This was followed by a quartet of scrumptious sides.Fleming's Potatoes is a decadent house specialty - scalloped, molded like a brick, and heavy with cream and cheddar cheese with a bit of jalapexc3xb1o (photo: http://bit.ly/2lqva6X), and the Truffle-Parsley Mashed Potatoes, saturated in cream and butter, made it a double header of artery-clogging starchy goodness. The Grilled High Country Asparagus and Sautxc3xa9ed Mushrooms made a valiant attempt to offset the potatoes but to little avail (photo: http://bit.ly/2ksVLvW). The main attraction was, of course, the steak, and the 12-ounce Main Filet Mignon was tender, iron-crusted and drizzled with melted butter (photo: http://bit.ly/2kayDkJ). Quite a treat.As if we were not wallowing in enough self-indulgence, there was a triple helping of dessert. The Walnut Turtle Pie was gooey good with housemade caramel, walnuts, and chocolate (photo: http://bit.ly/2kVaBPi), and the New York Cheesecake was classically conventional with its graham cracker crust and blueberry sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2kao6pV). My favorite was the Crxc3xa8me Brxc3xbblxc3xa9e, a large serving of Tahitian vanilla bean custard served with fresh berries (photo: http://bit.ly/2kaByda). Stuffed, uncomfortably so, but it certainly made me amenable to a return visit to a Fleming's near me on my dime.

Yeah, that's not why I was there. I was staying at the Renaissance for a week-long business trip and didn't have a car, so dining options for me and my colleagues were limited to this complex. We had already tried the Yard House, so we thought we'd take a chance with this modern-looking Japanese restaurant. It's a large space that doesn't really look like any Japanese restaurant that I've been to.The menu went on for quite a while with a heavy focus on rolls. I thought we could share a $12.95 Rainbow Roll which looked like it was slapped together in the dark (photo: http://bit.ly/2d7BvwV). Rainbow rolls are a good litmus test to see if the fish is fresh, and it passed that test if just barely. Somewhat better was the $13.95 Hamaichi Sake Box, which honestly looked like it was made with a sushi kit. It had layers of salmon and crab between the rice and it was topped off by pieces of yellowtail (photo: http://bit.ly/2cvIPBB). Again what I was missing was the creative aplomb a true sushi chef would have applied.Filling up on the rolls, I just ordered the $6.95 Mixed Tempura appetizer as my entree (photo:  http://bit.ly/2cGOwzC), and this was marginally the best part of my meal probably because my expectations weren't that high at this juncture even if the strange dark brown tone was off-putting. There was actually plenty of shrimp alternating withe the vegetables on my plate. In standard order, it came with a sloppy green salad and a bowl of miso soup first, but the highlight was the small $15.95 bottle of the Hakutsuru Superior Sake served on ice (photo: http://bit.ly/2cUl36O). It offered a nice melon fragrance that was unexpected but refreshing on a typically humid Phoenix evening. Regardless, a return visit doesn't seem likely.FOOD - 2 stars...weak on most fronts with the sake the only real salvationAMBIANCE - 2 stars...suburban contemporary setting doesn't feel very evocative of anything close to JapanSERVICE - 2 stars...inconsistent at bestTOTAL - 2 stars...faux-Japanese",11,gogO5RF4Rqz2THF1ATcCew,7,C9XKg39JOXGFXfFbkpM7tw,9/18/2016,2,7,27,6770 N Sunrise Blvd,"{'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'Caters': False, 'HasTV': True, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BikeParking': True, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}}","['Japanese', 'Restaurants', 'Asian Fusion', 'Sushi Bars']",Glendale,"{'Monday': '11:00-22:30', 'Tuesday': '11:00-22:30', 'Friday': '11:00-23:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-22:30', 'Thursday': '11:00-22:30', 'Sunday': '11:00-22:00', 'Saturday': '11:00-23:00'}",1,33.53395432,-112.2610474,Kabuki Japanese Restaurant,,85305,406,3.5,AZ,Restaurant,Arizona,Ed

Seems more like a full-grope fondle if you ask me since they serve nothing but Thai food at this strip mall restaurant off Bell Road in north Phoenix. I sometimes come down to our office down here for meetings, and since I have a reputation for being a San Francisco foodie, i.e., snob, they fret over where to take me for lunch. I've been driven here twice now, and I have to say the Thai food is solid stuff in the journeyman way it's prepared. Gee, that did sound like a snot wrote that, didn't it? I can't deny who I am, can I?Anyhow, I've always been here during the all-important lunch hour from 11AM to 2:30PM to take advantage of the Lunch Special menu. After all, each special is ""served with soup, eggroll and fried wonton"" (photo: http://bit.ly/2nYn8U9). What more do you want in the sweltering heat of Phoenix? First came the Thai Cabbage Soup, a hearty cupful of chicken broth, shredded cabbage and sliced celery that reminded me more of Dublin than Bangkok save for the aggressive dousing of Thai chile sauce I gave it (photo: http://bit.ly/2mGcz80). My entree was the Gang Ga-Ree Gai, the classic Thai yellow curry dish with chicken, carrots, and potatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/2nlBA5y). The base of the dish is the spicy coconut milk that appeared to have thickened to a stew-like consistency from the potatoes in particular. It was a milder curry than most, probably a good thing since I was boarding a flight in a couple of hours and don't need to be a belching machine in coach. The scoop of rice was essential, the egg roll and fried won ton far less so.

That isn't such a monumental discovery for anyone who actually lives in Phoenix, but for the hopeless San Francisco food snob that I am, it does please me to have choice in the midst of the sometimes scalding weather here. Funny thing is that they have ""No Pho"" signs on the wall, so don't even think about asking for it here. No, they are focused on noodle bowls, rice plates and banh mis, and yes, they're located in a strip mall next to Naked BBQ. Where else would they be in North Phoenix?I came with a couple of colleagues who seemed to know what to order. One ordered the $8 Grilled Pork Noodle Salad Bowl which looked good enough for me to copy. It was a good-size bowl with plenty of rice vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts, sliced cucumbers, pickled carrots, mint leaves, and of course, lettuce. It was topped with chopped scallions, crushed peanuts, and a sweet rice vinaigrette. You get two sides per order, so I went with the Deep-Fried Vegetable Egg Roll which was placed on top of the bowl (photo: http://bit.ly/2fbznV5). And then the Spring Roll stuffed with pork, shrimp, noodles, and vegetables (photo: http://bit.ly/2fPMhcL).It was hearty, fresh, crunchy when it was supposed to be, and certainly at the same level of similar bowls I would find back in the Bay Area with far less of a queue at the lunch hour. My other colleague went with the Grilled Shrimp Salad without the noodles but with plenty of bean sprouts, and she assured me she didn't miss the noodles (photo: http://bit.ly/2gancx3). I needed some libation in that sticky climate, so I had a $3.50 Vietnamese Iced Coffee with condensed milk which basically hit the spot (photo: http://bit.ly/2gclDO4), even though I had plenty of caffeine in my system from all the meetings in the morning.

So it's my own fault, really. I do have a penchant for ordering dishes named after the restaurant, as I assume they are specialties and thus among their best options, and the Dakota Chopped Salad sounded delightful:It was to have organic baby field greens, Persian romaine, AND iceberg lettuce. I was intrigued by this foreign romaine, and excited to see how it differed from regular old hearts of romaine. Unfortunately, iceberg was all that was to be found.Promised were heirloom cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, regular tomato, carrots, avocado, grilled corn, crispy bacon, garbanzo beans, feta, and a yogurt dill dressing. Of all that, there was a bit of tomato (neither heirloom nor cherry), maybe three bits of bacon, a smattering of feta, cucumber, and several kernels of corn. There was no carrot, maybe a tiny morsel of avocado, and the dressing was nowhere to be found (upon asking for some on the side, I received a tasty ramekin full of it, although it was unappetizingly separating).

I do have a penchant for ordering dishes named after the restaurant, as I assume they are specialties and thus among their best options, and the Dakota Chopped Salad sounded delightful:It was to have organic baby field greens, Persian romaine, AND iceberg lettuce. I was intrigued by this foreign romaine, and excited to see how it differed from regular old hearts of romaine. Unfortunately, iceberg was all that was to be found.Promised were heirloom cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, regular tomato, carrots, avocado, grilled corn, crispy bacon, garbanzo beans, feta, and a yogurt dill dressing. Of all that, there was a bit of tomato (neither heirloom nor cherry), maybe three bits of bacon, a smattering of feta, cucumber, and several kernels of corn. There was no carrot, maybe a tiny morsel of avocado, and the dressing was nowhere to be found (upon asking for some on the side, I received a tasty ramekin full of it, although it was unappetizingly separating).

Not worst in the sense that I have a juicy story to share but that it took ever so long to get a small order fulfilled in comparison to their competitors next door.  Ya know, the motorist traveling the interstate is probably their most typical sort of consumer and their everyday challenge is to win some of that motorist business.  I would think that Burger King would staff only their best to support these needs of the weary traveler, yes? Maybe?  Absolutely not.  Their customer service is pretty good and their employees are able to converse appropriately but their turn around times in serving just plain STINK!.  In the not-so-recent past, upon visits to Chicago BK's I would remember staff asking drive-up customers to reverse or move forward so that they could fake out BK corporate about how quickly they could meet customer demand. (Faking out their drive-up window timers)  These kinds of requests were not made here.  Instead we waited and waited and waited, for typical, every-order, type BK items.  The wait was so long that we started taking note of how quickly their neighbor Arby's, were able to respond to their drive-up business in far more suitable times.Originally we thought about hitting Arby's but they had a sizable line and for some reason we thought between the two fast food evils, this would be the better.

BUT - I see the word ""Pho"" in the window - my fears are allayed. For a moment.I walk in and am seated. The ambiance is quite nice. However, it all goes downhill a bit from there. There is no Pho Ga on the menu. My waiter is confused when I ask him about Pho Ga. I explain that it is the equivalent of Vietnamese Chicken noodle soup.So then he points me to their ""Pho Thit Heo Nuong,"" which is defined as: Combination Rice Noodles Beef Soup with Grilled Chicken. This does not sound right - but I decide to try it. I also order a side of Summer rolls.The Summer rolls come out first - with a side of a peanut dipping sauce - which is a bit on the runny/watery side. I add some Sriracha sauce to it - and it seems to be that the Sriracha sauce is not as thick as it should be - it seems a little on the thin side from a consistency perspective.The rolls themselves are good. I added squirts of Sriracha sauce to several bites of the rolls - definitely not as thick as it should be and not as hot as I am used to - I think they have cut or diluted the Sriracha sauce here.Then the soup is brought out - a plate of sliced grilled chicken, a bowl of Beef Pho broth with noodles, and a plate of aromatics - bean sprouts, two jalapeno slices, some basil, and a lime wedge. I taste the broth - this is definitely not Pho Ga broth. I taste the grilled chicken - it's very tasty. Just not what I was expecting when I walked in. I dumped the grilled chicken into the broth, added some Sriracha sauce and ate the whole thing.The soup does not even come close to many of the Pho places back in Virginia.",3,uma0HNsysznSfPbQb2HD5g,1,Mzr9daHNsayAENSUddc36w,11/4/2008,2,0,0,"1333 Savoy Plz, Ste 8","{'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Restaurants', 'Vietnamese']",Savoy,{},0,40.0704268,-88.2515456,Saigon Vietnamese Cuisine,,61874,14,3.5,IL,Restaurant,Illinois,Neal

An ode to those days we were free of responsiblity and full of hope.  We all saddled up on a Friday after work and embarked on our trip down the beloved (or loathed) 57.  Ahh, we were on our way.The 2.5 hour car ride consisted of us recalling those amusing college times - Illini basketball, cramming for midterms, wasting time on AIM, discovering Everclear.  Then, there was the discussion of our favorite UIUC food items.  It ranged from Basil Thai to Empire to Nyros to Murphy's burgers.  And Gumby's.Pokey Stix. *droooool*That pizza-esque, cripsy cheesy bread.   Greasy goodness.  With a side of ranch.  On our trek back from the bar to the hotel, I decided that we HAD to have Pokey Stix.  Our trip wouldn't be complete without it!  Best decision ever.  Thanks to homecoming and the influx of starving alum, Gumby's was running a 2-for-1 deal.  So, 2 medium Pokey stix, 3 sides of ranch and 2 sides of marinara came out to ONLY $15.  After my first bite, it was a better than I remembered.  Amazingly delicious!  I'm a little ashamed to say that the 5 of us basically devoured those Pokey Stix.  Devoured might be putting it a little too lightly, though.  Frealz.  We need Pokey Stix in Chicago.  Ya'll agree?Soooo, we relived youth - yessir!

It was the best.  So I stopped in to check the specials a behold  there it was on the board.  I told the server I already know what I want.  When I got the it I could see it didn't look the same.  It was a purposely misshaped disk...  You know the frozen hamburgers that some idiot thought if they don't make it perfectly round then sucker customers might think it was homemade.  Same with this.  I tasted it and could tell it was frozen.  I only tried to get the server attention about 9 times and she just focused elsewhere.  Finally she noticed me 10 minutes later.  I said I can tell this is frozen from a box to the fryer.  She said,  ""yeah."" I said I always came here for this dish and it was the best anywere!  Are there new owners or a change of cooks.  She said the restaurant was bought by new owners.  I  told her I don't come to a restaurant to eat frozen food.  I  could buy that frozen in a store for $2.99.  I  wouldn't because I can make it homemade. how hard is it to pound out roundsteak dredge in seasoned flour and egg and fry it?  Not very, especially for a restaurant.  It really bothers me when a restaurants put out sh*t instead of making the best food they can.  LAZINESS and lack of committed to quality.  And more so a lack of respect for their diners to give them frozen crap and expect them not to notice.  I left.

I also found out they offer full-service catering. The hostesses were friendly (they put up with me) and knowledgeable.The place eventually became crowded. It was somewhat hilarious (and a little offensive) how one kid was watching a DVD at the table (who brings their kid - and their personal player - to a place like Rosemary's?). It was all the more obvious since the room was dim (relatively speaking: the tables in the front bar area were better lit). Our dining room suffered from ""mood lighting"" and would benefit from seat or table spotlights; I like to see what I'm eating. Others may argue that they don't want to see their date, so this place may be good for you!Service was outstanding. Our primary server and his assistant explained every dish (even the beer selections). Like Perrier's Le Bec-Fin, the servers were enthusiastic and placed the dishes on the table in unison. Unlike LBF, the servers didn't buzz around the table like insects.I was running on an hour of sleep, so I (wisely) refrained from having alcohol but a friend had the beer-meal pairings, which he enjoyed.A few of us ordered the chef's tasting menu ($70). Compared to typical tasting menus, the overall package was a generous size and we weren't able to finish it all. The courses which grabbed my attention (even through my sleepy stupor) were:- l'amuse bouche (I was amused)- First course: salmon tartar appetizer with watercress, caviar, crackers and a saffron sauce- Fourth course: rack of lamb with Kalamata olive mashed potatoes, fried arugula, and a rosemary bordelaise sauce (mmmmmm - quite savory and the lamb was oh-so-tender)Lackluster courses:- Second course: Panko crab boulettes with marinated cucumbers (flavorless)- Third course: Crispy skin striped bass with hushpuppies and a creole meuniere sauce (not too much flavor, and not a fan of fish)- Dessert: I don't remember the dessert - not my thing anyway.Rosemary's is 30-40 minutes from the Strip, but worth the cab ride there.

Their chicken tom yum soup (8.95), flavored with mushrooms, lemongrass, chili and lime juice, helped ward off hunger.For entrees, try their pad thai chicken (8.95), stir-fried with bean sprouts, and a lime on the side.

It's my artistic release ritual for the day. I clutched my makeup filled suitcase tightly as I got off the flight to Vegas. I couldn't have been more thrilled about the makeup fests that were going to take place that weekend. Vegas is where you bring your sparkle. Vegas requires stage-makeup. The bright lights will wash you out. Everything is too much. And supposed to be.So that first night, when we all realized that dinner plans at Koi would cut into our makeup time before watching La Reve. We knew that we needed an alternative dinner plan pronto. We rushed over to our concierge for advice.Probably the most on-point concierge ever, Angie asked us about our time constraints, how far we wanted to travel - and recommended grabbing a spot at the bar at Okada.Some of the best advice we received that whole weekend.Okada was a swank, well lit, and beautiful space. It's easily a destination spot.  As soon as we arrived, we let our waitress know we were in a rush, and she seated us right away at the bar - right in front of the sushi chef.

Located inside of a strip mall just around the corner of Wynn/Encore, this spot is the perfect alternative to the spendy options of late night spots mid-strip. Folks who are familiar with the Cali locations should notice the mini-spike in prices here from .15-45 cents per item. It's still a inexpensive deal on the Strip and an even cheaper / tastier option that most tacos in NYC. I digress.The late night hours from Thursday-Sunday is often their busiest times here. Lines from post-XS / Tryst crowds of drunken club goers crowd up this small spot. No sense in sprinting to Earl of Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas#hrid:rCEJrFmkm-Y5nNg1MhO7VQ) when the $10 for a sandwich translates to 4 tacos and a drink here.A true San Diegan Mexican treat - the carne asada fries ($10) are the real deal. A mile high mountain of carne asada beef, salsa, cheese, and crema over fries is terrible for anyone's diet but delicious nonetheless. Tacos of all kinds - adobados, carnitas, de cabeza, orejas, lenguas - are superb in every sense. Vegans ought to look the other way but carnivores of the Mexican loving kind will be delighted with most everything on the menu. There is no words to describe the joy of fresh, shaved, carnitas on a perfectly grilled corn tortilla with a little salsa verde, cilantro and bits of cebolla, all folded to make for a juicy, super sabrosa bite.I could go on and on about these tacos, but if there is any thing worth mentioning it's that the Downtown location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas) is even better.

For locals and I, this has remained a favorite spot for their fusionesque approach toward comfort food. Sporting a tiny parking lot and a strip mall locale, the low key vibes of KoMex immediately reminds me of places I'd see in Hawaii (the food also screams Hawaii as well). Dated interior with a homey feel, this unassuming spot has family vibes written all over it. Popular during lunch time but a real casual option in the evening, this place gets better and better each time I visit.Service gets major points for their willingness to please and the family of youngsters are always putting their game face on. They've been polite and welcoming since my first visit and do a good job despite the demand. Management has done well with keeping the food interesting and affordable. Ordering food can be a bit on the slow side, but they've prefaced this by noting the food is made with love.They've done well with the bulgolgi and I'm certain have created hardcore fans as a result of it. One could rock bulgolgi fries, bulgolgi burritos, or even the amazingly hearty bulgolgi torta. Go next level with the bulgolgi grilled cheese, bulgolgi tater tots or a traditional bulgolgi plate with rice and salad. With this meat, anything (delicious) is possible.For non-bulgolgi items, I have been enamored with their beef kimchi fried rice. Order a runny egg and take a deep breath when the yolk magically weaves everthing together. While I enjoy the spicy pork rice plate, I also love the pork belly musubi. Nachos with any of the aforementioned meats is highly recommended. Don't feel the need to dine in? Go for takeout, but I'd recommend calling in ahead of time. For my fellow hangul speaking friends, this is the antithesis of traditional Korean food, so don't be disappointed when jungols / jigaes are missing from the menu.

They haven't lost a beat with their newer surroundings, as they serve some of the best breakfast in the city while providing incredible service all at the same time.Their new spot is one giant dining room space; complete with the retro black and white checkered floor tile (#1) and a number of tables for all groups and sizes. There is a TV playing in the corner for the morning crowd and the staff is usually warmly greeting folks as they come in and leave. The hustle and bustle in the back kitchen becomes hard to ignore; a subtle reminder for what most people (and I) are here to eat.Their menu is practically exclusive to the quintessential American breakfast experience while featuring a decent number of other diner classics such as salads, sandwiches, and soups. I've been a sucker for hashbrowns and theirs is as good as any. Perfectly crispy, aromatic, and extremely complementary to any additional breakfast item. My last go around here was a magical plate of corned beef hash with two smooth and silky eggs over easy. I ordered a side of avocado to smear onto my toast, which was glorious in itself. Everything was so delicious, I was secretly cursing at myself knowing nothing like this exists where I live.I took my time, polished off a glass of orange juice and just marveled how simple and wonderful these foods are. Sure, I had just finished a stint on the other side of the world and was basking in the nostalgia of hashbrown glory that I was experiencing at Mr Mamas, but the food only made me think of every other time I've been here in past trips, which were all excellent.A huge shout out to the owners / management who go out of their way to make sure as customers that we feel every bit as wonderful as we did regardless of how many visits.

Luckily for Vegas, this one is a winner, winner. Now all I'm missing is a chicken dinner.But there's a lot more to be had. Like all Yard House menus, the variety spans from Americana to Asian in one giant menu. It's like Cheesecake Factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. If there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from Hawaiian Poke to Korean Kalbi to Shrimp Ceviche, let it be here.As a venue, this Yard House is stacked. A robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with TVs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded Monday Night Football viewing. Who ever said this side of Vegas (Town Square) was boring? Certainly not I.My hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($12)Kung Pao Calamari ($11)Seared Ahi Sashimi ($14)Boneless Wings ($13)Hawaiian Poke Stack ($14)Turkey Club ($11)Spicy Tuna Roll ($13)All in all, everything was decent. The chicken lettuce wraps were fresh, tasty, and abundant. Wasn't the biggest fan of the kung pao calamari, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. While the turkey club, boneless wings, and spicy tuna roll (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the seared ahi and poke stack were the surprising winners of the night. Extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? Most definitely.While I'm not one to frequent chains, I can see myself coming back to this Yard House with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company.

I love Penang style Malaysian food so we thought we should give this one a shot.There was only one table on the weeknight that we visited. The owner's little boy was running around which didn't bother us at all. He was kinda cute, coming up and checking lil guy out and then running off again. We noticed he was playing with the stereo system and commented on how funny it would be if he suddenly turned the volume up really loud. I perused the menu and located some of the items I wanted to try and promptly ordered.Roti canai ($3.25) is a must when eating with hubby and lil guy. The one here was outstanding. The accompanying curry sauce with a piece of chicken and potato was so flavorful that lil guy ate the entire thing on his own. Hubby and I ate a piece each to taste. Lil guy even ate the spicy curry sauce and it wasn't lame like the one at Satay Malaysian Grill. This one had some heat to it. I was very proud that lil guy's taste buds were so refined, and most of all refined enough to like this one over the one at Satay. He was right, this one was far better than the one at Satay.My other favorite dish is Hainan Chicken Rice ($5.75) and when it arrived I immediately dove in. WOW. The chicken was tender, the soy sauce was perfect and the accompanying chili/ginger sauce was awesome. I had to ask for more sauce it was THAT good. The chicken flavored rice was also delicious. Lil guy even liked this dish. I was very very happy.We also got the Hokkien Char Mee or Hokkien style fried noodles ($6.95) was the weakest dish of all. They used the wrong noodles.... should've been egg or 'oil' noodles in Chinese, but it tasted like they used a variation of udon noodles. It was either that or they overcooked it so the texture became mushy. Wrong texture but good flavor.Service was so-so, not bad but not outstanding. However, the meal was excellent so I was happy.

I was pretty certain they'd be open, but just to make sure I called beforehand. I tried starting at 10am but no answer.... closer to 11am they answered and indeed were open -- at 11am!We headed over there, got seated, looked at a menu and our server, a Shanghainese man, seemed quite pleased to speak my home dialect with me.They don't have salty soy milk and if you want sweet soy milk, you can add the sugar yourself. What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.The XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.Potstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!Sheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. And how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.Definitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!Cong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.I saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little. The sweet sauce they drizzle into it is also not overtly sweet and so, enhances the flavors without making it sickly sweet.Definitely some really above average Chinese/Taiwanese breakfast foods I've tasted!

Lil guy had udon with vegetables, agedashi tofu ($7) and an order of edamame ($5).First course: trio of 2 slices of toro drizzled with a yuzu soy sauce; tuna tartare with yuzu and avocado; toro tartare stack with beluga caviar and gold flakes. I was impressed with how my meal started. Everything on this plate tasted great and was beautifully presented although both the tartares kind of stuck to the plate when I tried to pick it up with my chopsticks and I ended up having to scrape it off with my chopsticks.Second course (although it should really be the 4th): duo of hamachi and kanpachi. The former consisted of a garlic soy yuzu sauce while the latter was sitting in a marinade of black truffle oil and yuzu. Again both were rather pleasing to the palate.Third course (or is it the 6th now): beef tataki of thinly sliced Kobe beef drizzled with a soy sauce infused with garlic. Paper thin slivers of fried garlic on each slice of beef were accompanied with daikon sprouts. I didn't like the taste of the beef. It just didn't taste like how raw Kobe beef should taste - strong and rather off putting. The heavy sauce managed to mask the unpleasantness of the beef and the fried garlic helped immensely so it was still palatable in the end.Satay lobster in uni butter sauce as this dish was present also came with one large scallop - slightly overcooked so it was a tad chewy. I didn't think the satay complemented the dish at all. In fact, it overpowered the delicate flavor of uni and ended up making this dish mediocre at best. Beef short rib arrived very artistically presented. It included white asparagus, edamame, caramelized pearl onion and a small sliver of foie gras atop the beef. I loved the taste of the foie gras but the beef short rib was nothing special. It was no different than good galbijim and therefore didn't impress.I have no idea why they decided to add lobster to the miso soup because it did nothing for it. The miso soup itself was watery and unflavorful and the chunks of lobster meat was bland. It's hard to believe that a high end restaurant like this couldn't present a tastier version of something as simple as miso soup.The final portion of the meal before dessert was the sushi. I thought it was excellent that they gave you fresh wasabi because it definitely enhances the sushi experience. However, I was extremely disappointed in the sushi itself. The rice was still on the al dente side and the fish was also not of superb quality. Maguro and salmon were okay - I've had far better elsewhere. The hirame (flounder) was surprisingly gristly. It was chewy and crunchy! Not very pleasant. I enjoyed the hamachi though, it was almost buttery in texture. I liked the ume which accompanied the sushi. This course was wonderfully presented (see photo).I was at the end of the meal portion and felt let down. It started off with a bang but slowly went downhill. How does this happen in an establishment such as this? Aren't the courses supposed to build into a crescendo until it explodes and then give the diner a sense of climax in the end?I guess the chef did somehow make it up with dessert because it was excellent. I being not a dessert fan had nothing but great things to say about the dessert trio which arrived. The rich chocolate ganache cake infused with sake was superb. The other two (names fail me) were also good. Both had something fruity in it so it wasn't heavy at all.If I only had the first two courses and then the final dessert, I would've given them 5 stars. I thought service could've been better. They brought me a refill of iced tea ($3) once and then forgot about it. The courses also came out a tad too quickly, often before I'd even finished the previous course. For a high-end establishment it was lacking both in service and the quality of food it was serving especially since I was paying $130 for the tasting menu. What truly rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that I ordered udon for the lil guy and the menu had shrimp tempura udon for $16. Since lil guy didn't eat shrimp I asked if they could do it with vegetables instead. The server told me sure they could but failed to inform me that I would be charged the same price. If I had known, I would've just ordered the shrimp tempura and ate it myself. In the end, I was charged $16 for plain udon with a few vegetables in it. When I questioned the server his response was ""it's not on the menu"". WTF??? This type of customer service is a reflection of poor management. Just because something is not on the menu doesn't mean you can't be flexible and offer a service to a customer when they ask for it. But after you offer that service you need to tell them that they would be charged the same amount and then let them make that decision.Ordinarily it would've been a 3 star rating but overall, they only get a 2.",6,KVsv8wRGnLX8QWoNZKNMQA,5,Mx_C_uDFCqFP5enqawT41A,12/31/2007,2,2,50,"MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, 3799 Las Vegas Boulevard South","{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'dressy', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': True, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'no', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'Open24Hours': False, 'BikeParking': False, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 4, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'RestaurantsCounterService': True}","['Sushi Bars', 'Japanese', 'Restaurants']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '17:30-22:30', 'Tuesday': '17:30-22:30', 'Friday': '17:30-23:00', 'Wednesday': '17:30-22:30', 'Thursday': '17:30-22:30', 'Sunday': '17:30-22:30', 'Saturday': '17:30-23:00'}",0,36.10265075,-115.1689884,Shibuya,The Strip,89109,706,4,NV,Restaurant,Nevada,Anita

We were just driving around and I noticed in huge Chinese writing for xiao long bao $3.95. Hubby said ""let's go eat there"". I'm like ""right now?"" He's like ""yeah"". It was 4pm and it was neither here nor there, but I complied.We get in there and the Shanghainese owner seated us. He was pretty funny. After finding out I could speak the language, he came over and talked and talked with us. We got the XLB since it was so cheap hoping it would be good. They also had 'ma lan tou' which is a cold appetizer (which I love). We also ordered scallion pancakes which is lil guy's favorite. Stir fried rice cake is also another favorite of our's so we got an order of that too.  I then noticed they also had salty soy bean milk which, generally is on the weekend menu of many restaurants but here, you can get it at any time.The rice cakes was delicious, so was the ma lan tou. Lil guy loved the scallion pancakes AND the rice cakes. Hubby loved the salty soy milk. I thought the soy milk was really good.... again so surprising in Las Vegas of all places. The only thing which was not up to par to Din Tai Fung of course as the wrapper was on the thick side, but for $3.95, it was alright.To find such good Shanghainese food is one thing in the LA area, but in Vegas? I was pretty blown away. The owner was tickled pink watching hubby eat all the traditional foods commenting on it whenever he could.

I'm usually a huge fan of the Westin and although this particular location isn't as nice as the majority of them worldwide, it still has all the fixings which I love about the Westin.Check in was a breeze and friendly. It didn't take much time at all before we were all headed up to our room. I like the fact that this was a smaller hotel and that we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. The other redeeming factor was that it didn't smell like smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casino area, but since it's so small, you don't have a host of people hanging out anyway.Between 5 and 7pm, there is a complimentary happy hour for all guests. You can go down to Suede restaurant and enjoy wine, beer, snacks -- all unlimited -- for 2 hrs. We went down and got some fruit, cheese, chips and they had some pretty tasty wine available as well as various beers and soft drinks.Later, we were making tea in our room and ran out of tea bags, cups and water (they give you Nestle bottled water for free to make tea and coffee with) so we called housekeeping and within 5 mins they had brought us some more.The Heavenly bed is out of this world -- I just dozed off in the middle of the afternoon enveloped in its comfort. The shower is another plus with its signature 2 shower heads.We did have a problem with the AC as it wouldn't register any lower than 72 degrees. I had set it to 65 degrees before we left to go out for dinner and when we returned, it was the same temp. So I again called downstairs and they sent an engineer within 5 minutes. He brought us a bar of chocolate -- how awesome is that?He changed the filter and fixed the problem and was out the door in less than 10 mins. The room remained cool for the whole night. So for me, this was an awesome experience. The service was out of this world. My previous experiences with other hotels is that you can call them, but they won't arrive for at least 15-20mins. I would definitely come back again the next time we visit Vegas. I'm done with all those kitschy flashy hotels.Oh, and winning money at the casino was another huge plus!!4.5 stars!!!",18,makqSKZaz1aUipoWBW0BsA,14,qrLN56hit8NtWPITJRoi8w,5/12/2009,5,11,42,160 East Flamingo Rd,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'WiFi': 'free'}","['Casinos', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Hotels', 'Restaurants', 'Arts & Entertainment']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.115198,-115.165729,Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Eastside,89109,591,3,NV,Restaurant,Nevada,Anita

We didn't manage to eat here on our last trip, so this time around, we decided to try and get in there on our first night in Vegas. We didn't make a reservation and it was around 7.30pm when we got there. Even though it was a Monday night, they looked pretty packed, but then again, where isn't it packed in Vegas every single night of the week?Luckily they had a table for us. Before we even ordered, a plate of complimentary appetizers were placed on the table... olives, toasted slices of baguette and some balls of either cheese or flavored butter - I couldn't tell what it was really.Hubby ordered sangria ($6). ACK, it was awful and tasted like they used cheap wine in it. I stuck with iced tea. After we ordered, the food arrived rather quickly. Boquerones ($5) on toast was okay. The marinated anchovies weren't the best I'd ever had, but we hadn't had boquerones for a long time now so we really felt like some. Really awesome bocquerones has no trace of fishiness, but these ones did have a slight fishy taste to it.Fried calamari was also okay. It was pretty good although again a little too much batter to my liking. But it wasn't rubbery so that was a plus. The camarones al ajillo was not bad, but hubby said I could've easily made that dish at home so it wasn't anything which blew him away.The duck rolls with hoisin sauce were pretty disgusting in my book. The rolls were like egg rolls but stuffed with duck. It had WAY too much hoisin sauce making them just TOO TOO sweet. It actually made my mouth pucker from just one bite. I did not like these at all. The last tapa we ordered were the lamb chops which were served with a red wine reduction. This was clearly the star of the evening. Perfectly grilled with the sauce enhancing the lamb chops instead of throwing the entire dish off like the hoisin sauce on the duck rolls. It was served on a very flavorful bed of lentils, zucchini spaghetti strands and artichokes. I would definitely order this dish again.5 tapa, 1 glass of sangria, an iced tea and one lemonade came to slightly under $55 before tip. Kinda pricey if you ask me. Service was okay, nothing to write home about. Now that I've eaten here, I don't think I'll come back again on a future trip. There are just way too many great restaurants in Vegas to return to Firefly. Food was mediocre, but I think if you are in Vegas partying, this place has great atmosphere and is good for downing alcohol and having a small bite to eat. However, we aren't the partying type even if lil guy wasn't in tow. All we want is awesome food at reasonable prices (or even awesome food at not so reasonable prices) and Firefly certainly doesn't fall into that category.",3,5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg,2,npYJcnNzfkTYHg19_U7vyw,8/24/2007,3,1,37,3900 Paradise Rd,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'loud', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'no', 'Caters': True, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'Corkage': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'Open24Hours': False, 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}}","['Restaurants', 'Tapas/Small Plates', 'Tapas Bars']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '11:30-2:00', 'Tuesday': '11:30-2:00', 'Friday': '11:30-2:00', 'Wednesday': '11:30-2:00', 'Thursday': '11:30-2:00', 'Sunday': '11:30-2:00', 'Saturday': '11:30-2:00'}",0,36.1188384,-115.1544802,Firefly,Eastside,89169,1313,4.5,NV,Restaurant,Nevada,Anita

This time, even though it was good, it just didn't blow me away like last time. So one star off.---------------------------------THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. That was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. I wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. Man, it was bustling! Turns out they were open until 3am Mon-Sat, until 2.30am on Sundays. However, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.So there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. Lil guy was all for it. So, counter it was. I was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. There were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. They were obviously having a good time.We were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. Hubby left the ordering to me. I ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). Then, I proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.Uni pon ($5.50) arrived first. It was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. OMG it was fantastic. The uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. I could've eaten 3 of these.Then came the salmon skin salad ($5). This was no ordinary salmon skin salad. This was the emperor of all salmon skin salads I've ever had. Crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. Hubby and I shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel. Taramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something I've been craving since leaving Hawaii. I used to eat it at least once a week. After a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. The taramiso did not disappoint. In fact, it was so perfect hubby and I again commented on how much we've missed this dish.All the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable DVD player oblivious of all the ongoings around him. Tofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. Romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. The grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.Of course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. We had 2 large bottles of Asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). I'm sorry, but Santouka Ramen does not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. The broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. The chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. It looked like pancetta. Hubby was a bit skeptical but I assured him he would like it, and guess what? He did.This is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas, and let me tell you this, I'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, I'm not eating the food as I'm writing this.

I'm a sucker for good chocolate (and so is hubby BTW) so we walked in without really having any intentions of anything really. We just wanted to look.I perused the display and marveled at all the really exotic concoctions including 2 of my favorite flavors in the world: pandan and kaffir lime.We ended up getting a box of 9 truffles (totaling $27). I've eaten the pandan and the kaffir lime. Hmmm.... I don't know. The kaffir lime was pretty good with a hint of the lime aroma. However, the pandan didn't quite work with the chocolate for me.I'm waiting to try the one with balsamic vinegar, another with chili, and yet another with fennel and anise.Right now I think what I've eaten is good. Definitely above average as far as chocolates go, but, they were not mindblowingly good. I still love the taste of Valhrona. Will report back regarding how the others turn out.UPDATE: Here's the run down:Buddha's Leaf (pandan): didn't do anything for me. I keep expecting a hint of salty taste to it.Kaffir Lime: was quite pleasant with a hint of limeBalsamico (balsamic vinegar + hazelnuts): was so-so, couldn't really taste the balsamicBudapest (Hungarian paprika): this was okay. Hubby said he tasted the paprika, but it was like as if I was about to taste it and then it disappeared. Disappointing.Red Fire (ancho chile+ cinnamon): This was awesome. I totally tasted the chile peppers and there was no heat to it, just the great aroma of chile. So far, my favorite. Black Pearl (wasabi, ginger, black sesame seeds): couldn't really taste any of the ingredients. Tasted just like regular chocolate to me with sesame seeds on top.Alexis (curry): not bad.Absinthe (Chinese star anise + fennel): I generally like star anise and fennel, but I do not like licorice which is basically what the flavor is... but this worked really well.Ellateria (cardamon): I totally did not like this one.",2,LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA,3,2Xf0exnGsIhLcdQAWAmm0w,4/11/2007,4,0,35,3500 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BikeParking': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Food', 'Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt', 'Coffee & Tea', 'Chocolatiers & Shops', 'Specialty Food']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '10:00-23:00', 'Tuesday': '10:00-23:00', 'Friday': '10:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '10:00-23:00', 'Thursday': '10:00-23:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-23:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-0:00'}",0,36.11833216,-115.1743504,Vosges Haut-Chocolat,The Strip,89109,177,4.5,NV,Restaurant,Nevada,Anita

Last time, we were stuck on the Strip with either extravagantly expensive restaurants trademarked by brand name chefs or the $6.99 Prime Rib special. Nothing in between...nothing. Driving eight miles west of the Strip on Sahara Drive, you can find a stylish, low-key bistro in the middle of a strip mall. Yes, a strip mall. It's called Rosemary's, and there wasn't a sign of an obnoxious out-of-town gambler in the entire place. So here's the deal - $55 for a three-course prix fixe dinner, and you don't have to get two desserts. Instead, we went with three appetizers, two entrees and shared one dessert. Bonus points to Rosemary's for allowing such flexibility for the more peckish diners. It ended up being a whole lotta food, and most of it really good. We automatically got two big rolls on our bread plates, a Glazed White Chocolate Pecan and a Potato (see photo). Freshly baked and very tasty. We tried to save one for the dinner itself, but it was hard. Then we were given an amuse-bouche, a little square of Vegetable Bread Pudding with Shaved Chives that was a homey, heavenly pop in the mouth. The appetizers turned out to be a bit more hit-and-miss. The Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle with Garlic Cream Sauce and Saute of Wild Mushrooms (see photo) was impeccably presented but could have used more kick and texture to offset the excessive creaminess. The prawns in Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp were really succulent covered with the thick barbecue sauce, an unusual mix that mostly worked, but the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw was just a little too mayo-like to fully enjoy (see photo). I think a vinaigrette would have worked better. The winners among the appetizers had to be the Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with Emulsified Ravigote Sauce and Grandma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers (see photo) where the crunchiness of the boulette's outer crust went very well with the relish-like sauce. There was nothing wrong with the Arugula, Endive & Radicchio Salad (see photo) except for the fact that it was completely overshadowed by the showy appetizers. Our luck significantly improved with the two entrees - the Creole Grilled Prime Ribeye with Anson Mills Carolina Quick Grits, Crystal Red Onion Crust and Rosemary's Own Steak Sauce, and the Grilled Veal Tenderloin with Saute of Asparagus, Prosciutto & Maitake Mushrooms and Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce (see photos). Both were excellent - especially the way the meat was prepared, very tender and flavorful. Jamie and I were pretty full by this time (...we already had a to-go box ready for the leftover meat), but we couldn't leave without trying their Pecan Tart with Brown Sugar Ice Cream. If that wasn't enough, they left us a little plate of little cookies with the check (see photos). As good and abundant as the food was, it was really the attentive service that was most memorable about the meal. There seemed to be a trio of guys who were making sure we were served at exactly the right time and refilling our water glasses before they were empty. I kept imagining how much this experience would have cost if the place was in the Bellagio or the Wynn. So is it the Strip or a strip mall for you? Let your palate and pocketbook decide.

Yes, I know you're gobsmacked, but it's true and Naked City Pizza is the proof. I usually don't pay that much attention to the Triple-D man, Guy Fieri, the man who single-handedly destroyed the Food Network, but occasionally some places he recommends are actually good. One was Broken Record back in San Francisco, but this may be his best find yet. This isn't the one he went to either as another Naked City Pizza, presumably the original location, is on the other side of the Strip in the back of a dive bar on Arville. Now that sounds like Triple D. Off the hook, dude.This one is in a makeshift office building on the way to the airport which is exactly why Jamie W. and I ended up here. It wasn't crowded at about 5PM, just one ravenous family next to the window. The paper menu was a bit tattered, but we thought everything they offered appeared quite tempting. We decided the share the $7.50 Naked Salad, a bargain that combined iceberg lettuce, spinach, roasted sweet peppers, white onion, marinated tomato, and shredded mozzarella, all of it tossed in a housemade vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1RCNyjX). It was that tangy dressing along with the fresh ingredients that made this salad really hit the spot.Because of the subheader description, ""Featured on Food Network's DDD"",  the Guinea Pie was our pizza of choice. It's made the old-fashioned Sicilian way in a rectangular, cookie-sheet shape with a soft, aerated dough that was quite amazing. The main topping was what they referred to as Grandma's Meatballs, which looked to be sliced and mixed with mint, accompanied by baby spinach leaves, heaping spoonfuls of ricotta, mozzarella and white garlic sauce. We decided to go for the $14.95 quarter sheet, which was plenty since it consisted of six hefty pieces (photo: http://bit.ly/1QoTOco). I think that dough could have handled any topping, but the white-on-white, Buffalo-style combination worked really well.

But lo and behold, among the five-dollar-sign eateries in the elaborate casino is a semi-reasonably priced noodle house. By no means is this in the same class as Picasso or Le Cirque. It's a place for the rest of us, the ones who forked over a hundred bucks to see Cher across the street at Caesar's Palace and didn't want to sink the rest of our savings on a meal we were too tired to enjoy anyway.This being Vegas, it's a lot nicer and contemporary than your standard noodle joint. It has rows of jars filled with all sorts of dried noodles set against a lighted wall - lest you make a mistake that this is not a noodle joint. We were served right away at about 9:30 on a Saturday evening, and the waiter was super-attentive. Jamie and I shared an $8 basket of five Shui Mai...pretty good and in need of the mustard sauce to spice them up (see my photo). Jamie went for the $18 plate of Spicy and Sweet Noodles with Chicken - which impressed us with the heft of the poultry pieces (see my photo).But on my own, I decided to try their Congee Chicken - a smallish bowl with iddy-biddy chicken bits and scallions (see my photo). Not the best jook I ever had but it was nice balm for my then-sore throat. I thought the price was high at $13 - but it did hit the spot at a time when I least expected to have some comfort porridge.

We didn't feel like venturing that far away on the Strip just for a late bite. Y'see, we're not those guys with the giant bongs filled with frozen margarita, although I was intrigued by the sight of a giant plastic, margarita-filled guitar that a young girl was holding like Susanna Hoffs having a Manic Monday. Anyhow, that's who we figured were the type of diners that come to the House of Blues between guitar fill-ups. We were mistaken as this is a relatively family-friendly eatery that appears to cater to well-behaved bachelorette parties.Walking into a large space dominated by a big tree (photo: http://bit.ly/1TYHlmk), we saw a two-man band playing on a small stage. Not blues but '80's pop-rock like A Flock of Seagulls and Van Halen. A middle-aged woman would sometimes join them to play keyboards, quite essential when they performed ""Jump"". The Crossroads menu is TGIFish, but we didn't mind since we just wanted comfort food (photo: http://bit.ly/1XnVzL7). We both started out with the $8.99 Classic Wedge Salad, which was exactly that. A quarter-cut of iceberg lettuce with diced tomatoes, smoked Applewood bacon, and globs of blue cheese dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1Ua68TQ). Yep, that's it.Jamie decided to try the $18.99 Jambalaya for his entree. Marinated chicken and andouille sausage were mixed with sweet peppers and green onions in a rice saturated in their house special jambalaya sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/22bGT8C). It was a good portion and certainly hearty enough even if the sauce didn't have much spicy kick on its own. I ordered the $15.99 Juicy Lucy, an inverted beef and bacon burger stuffed with melted cheese and topped with spicy jalapexc3xb1o peppers and roasted tomatoes. The brioche bun was slathered with chipotle mayo which added good zing to a typical Midwestern creation (photo: http://bit.ly/1pFhvXw).

I remember passing by it near Union Square and wondering if the fusion would be too coy for my taste...or maybe too koi? OK, I thought that was funny. Anyway, I don't have to waste a meal on my next trip to Manhattan since the owners opened an outpost here in the Mirage in Vegas. I can well imagine this place has the same, coolish vibe as its sister eateries in New York and Chicago. But you have to bear the ongoing hum of the casino and the unending stream of foot traffic passing by. The verdict on the food? Pretty good but kinda spartan on the portions. Jamie W. and I were at the Mirage to see the Cirque de Soleil show, this one an elaborate Beatles tribute called ""Love"" just right across the floor. The hotel concierge was pressing Japonais on us as a dining option, and our apathy made us cave. They offer a Lounge Dinner for Two for $45 - which allows you and a companion to eat at the bar and have two appetizers and then share an entree and a dessert. That's not really a terrible deal - but the meal did leave us hungry after the show. We tried the Lobster Spring Rolls and the Sweet and Sour Calamari for starters (see my photos). The three rolls were good and crunchy, though I honestly couldn't tell if they did contained lobster in them. However, the mango relish and blood orange vinaigrette were nice tropical accents. The calamari had nice texture and came clumped together in a sweet sauce undercut by a wasabi vinaigrette. Against all odds, it worked especially with the black sesame seeds sprinkled on top. For our entree, Jamie and I split the Chestnut Chicken which was nicely marinated in a lemon ginger sauce. It came with a shiitake rice casserole with corn and peas and some sauteed brocollini (see my photo). Tasty though hardly what I would call fusion. Just wish I got more than half a breast. For dessert, it was the Chocolate Indulgence, a little mousse cake heavy on chocolate and ginger (see my photo).

Damn that Rachael Ray. Alas, I went to the Yelp app on my iPhone and found a nearby breakfast eatery that was also averaging around four stars. It literally took us about three minutes to get to Jamm's and big surprise...it's in a strip mall, our third off-the-Strip place that was in a strip mall. We noticed the place was abuzz with customers but not nearly to the level of the Hash House. There was a fifteen-minute wait here, and the diners were not nearly as fashionably attired. It's a modest operation, the type that has a cheery hostess and cartoon murals on the walls. The menu is pretty robust, but unlike the nearby Egg & I, there was a lot more thought and care in the execution of the dishes. Jamie W. ordered the $8.45 Reuben Omelet, which was full of strands of corned beef and mounds of sauerkraut. There was also a generous slab of Swiss cheese melted on top and a side of crispy hashed browns (see photo). I went for a similar dish, the $8.50 Irish Skillet, which had the same corned beef accompanied by diced onions, green peppers and potatoes, all mixed into scrambled eggs and melted cheddar cheese (see photo). It was a mess of high-cholesterol goodness well put together. Tasty too. Jamie, in a moment of insanity laced with homesickness for his Midwestern roots, also ordered the $5.25 full order of Biscuits and Country Gravy, which was a gloppy pool on a plate (see photo). I won't deny it wasn't good in a deep Southern kitchen kind of way with the biscuits sopping up all that gravy, though I attempted to re-purpose it as an extra topping for my skillet breakfast. Bloated was the way we both felt afterward but also sated. Needless to say, I also noticed they decorated the restroom stall with the same cartoon murals. Somebody must have had time on their hands. By the way, the waitress was also cheery, chatty and about nineteen. She was refilling my coffee cup with unadulterated pleasure.

While I was waiting I glanced at the receipt I noticed two double cheeseburgers were orders rather than one.... the cashier needs to have her ears checked!  She then gave me a refund for the extra double cheeseburger, and utter shock with my own eyes I saw her discard my receipt/order!

Rouses Point is short drive from St.Albans but long enough that I haven't been here since I was little. After reading the reviews for the places to eat in town, we settle on Gino's. We arrive to a almost full parking lot. We head inside to place our order, a large pizza and a order of poutine. 30 minute wait. That is fine and we head out to continue our drive, 15 minutes down the road (it was beautiful!) and 15 back. Foods still not ready and we are told 10 more minutes. We get back in the car head back over the bridge and get drinks, head back to wait. I take a spot outside with the maybe 10 folks chilling with a few dogs and some kids. It's a nice picnic area, very clean and well cared for.   Our pizza and poutine comes out it looks delicious! Being so close to the border I had my fingers crossed for some authentic cheese curd poutine, I was a little disappointed that they used mozzarella shredded cheese. I have discovered that it's really rare to come across real cheese curd poutine. The crust for the pizza was ""meh"" and the cheese wouldn't stay on the crust. My boyfriend informed me this was because they use a ""circular method"" for applying cheese. They add a lot in the middle of the pie and then work outwards using less cheese and not work it up to the crust when the sauce isn't. The cheese would stay on much better with even distribution up to the part of crust that has no sauce. I got a black cherry creemee. I asked for it to have a vanilla/black cherry swirl but that didn't happen. Sadness. My boyfriend got a root beer float, nothing special about it. He said ""It was a float."" The cashier seemed slightly agitated and I wouldn't have been surprised if I saw her roll her eyes, but she remained polite and was fairly formal. The girl at the creemee stand didn't have any personality and was just meh.

There was a lot of hemming and hawing from most people, but about 40% of them instantly pointed me toward Soul.That kind of percentage can't be ignored, so when I was able to drag myself out of bed the next morning, I headed over for brunch. I must admit that Soul and I got off on the wrong foot because they refused to serve me liquor before noon. However, once our server was able to gasp out (past my hands wrapped around his windpipe) that it was North Carolina's ridiculous law rather than their personal decision, we moved past it. And everything from that moment on was perfect, because everything included their shrimp and grits. Our lovely waiter Marlon sold me on the dish, and it truly was architecturally interesting as he described. Instead of a bowl of shrimp and grits (as I'm used to), it was more like fried grit cubes with the shrimp and sauce poured over. And it was beautiful, rich, salty amazingness. The only downside was that I wanted more. (Her french toast panini was nothing to sneeze at either, but I'm a savor-tooth tiger to the core.)I'm sure it would've been a better brunch with a bloody mary, but this was a meal I'll eat every time I'm in Charlotte, and you probably should too. _________________*Depending on your perspective, I suppose you could say that I bothered a lot of strangers.",8,NFm869_w6cvVaWaNpAzjeA,4,rsPiYMqfshrrU8qPQBp19g,6/5/2013,5,7,-2,1500-B Central Ave,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Music': {'dj': True, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': True, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': False, 'BikeParking': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': False, 'HappyHour': False, 'GoodForDancing': False, 'DogsAllowed': True, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': True, 'saturday': True}, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'CoatCheck': False, 'Smoking': 'outdoor', 'WheelchairAccessible': False}","['Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Tapas Bars', 'Lounges', 'Bars']",Charlotte,"{'Monday': '17:00-2:00', 'Tuesday': '17:00-2:00', 'Friday': '17:00-2:00', 'Wednesday': '17:00-2:00', 'Thursday': '17:00-2:00', 'Sunday': '17:00-2:00', 'Saturday': '17:00-2:00'}",1,35.2202136,-80.8133676,Soul Gastrolounge,Plaza Midwood,28205,822,4,NC,Restaurant,North Carolina,Peter

Our waitresses were attentive enough, listening to our request to pretty much leave us alone as we planned on hanging out for awhile.  The one thing they did do, however, was card us - we liked that!We did order the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer to start and enjoyed it... a little too much!  It was different than normal in that it was more like a flat bread pizza with a little extra dip on the side.  It was filling, rich, and creamy... it could've been a meal on it''s own.  However, we proceeded to order more drinks and 2 of the recommended dishes.  I had the parmesan crusted grouper and Sloan had the chicken and basil alfredo.  We weren't blown away by them, but they were not unforgettable either.  My fish was served warm but the veggies that came with it were cold... when I told our server, she brought an additional side of warm veggies for me - great customer service there!We skipped dessert as we were both pretty full... neither one of us finished our meals, so keep in mind that servings are pretty big.

We should have known the place would be packed when we couldn't find a parking space nearby, but we bit the bullet and parked a tad bit further and ran in through the pouring rain.  We had a short wait, but the hostesses were friendly and we were greeted by Stratos himself (of Stratos Restaurant Group who also has Big View Diner and Nolen Kitchen in his portfolio of restaurants).  We entertained ourselves by catching up, people-watching, and then finally, looking at the menu as we prepared for our order.  (The menu is huge by the way, so it was hard for us to narrow down what we wanted... everything sounded amazing from the appetizers , soups, salads, and sandwiches to the entrees , pizzas, pastas, and sides).We were seated at a table in the back after waiting just over 30 minutes or so... and we immediately ordered drinks and a ""Traditional Greek Spreads"" tasting plate, ""Pikilia.""  It came out pretty fast (along with whole wheat pita) and we dove right in... I highly recommend all of the spreads, but the Roasted Red Pepper spread was our fave!For our meals, I went with the Greek Country Salad and added lamb and Sloan went for the Capellini & Diver Scallops.  We shared two sides as well: Charred Asparagus and Greek ""Fries.""  Everything was delicious although I will warn you that if you order the Greek Country Salad, be prepared for lots of red onion!Service was pretty spot on.  Our waiter checked in with us often and refilled our drinks before they got too low.  He also replaced the cocktail napkins several times - gotta love that attention!

I've visited their La Jolla, Woodland Hills, and Walnut Creek locations (all in California) numerous times and have always had a wonderful experience.   When I saw that there was a Fleming's right across from my hotel, I made sure to dine here at the first opportunity.Being by myself, I opted to sit at the bar and started off with a Fleming's Classic Martini.   I sipped merrily on my cocktail while perusing their menu and honed in pretty quickly on the lamb chops and their Chipotle Mac & Cheese.The food arrived actually right as I took my last sip of martini.   Having ordered a beautiful meal, I figured I'd accompany it with a nice glass of red wine and I ordered a glass of Hall Cabernet at 18 dollars  (I know, ouch!)   Here's where they lost that 5th star:  they brought me a carafe and poured me the glass of red wine but I never actually got to see the bottle of Hall.    Now that's not saying that they totally gave me some cheap red wine instead of what I ordered.   While my palate isn't so sophisticated I certainly am able to tell the difference between swill and more elegant vintages.   Nevertheless, if I'm going to venture out and blow almost 20 bucks for a *glass* of wine, show me the bottle, will ya?The meal was lovely and the wine paired well with the lamb and Mac & Cheese.   I stuffed my face, royally and had a wonderful meal.   Most certainly I would come back in a heartbeat.    I actually had to laugh at some point when I looked down the bar and realized I was the only person there drinking wine.   Everybody had a glass of bourbon, or some martini or other, and that includes the few people that, like me, had opted to dine at the bar.     What's the dead giveaway that there's a Northern California in your restaurant, I chuckled to myself?

Most are pretty salty.There is a hot grill with ""junk food"" items like hot dogs, chili, fries, onion rings and burgers.  the turkey burger is DRY so I always get some tomatoe slices and lettuce along with alittle mayo and ketchup to make it more palatable.There are also cold sandwiches made to order, but you must be willing to wait while the ONE sandwich chef (who is overwhelmed by the long line at lunch) makes each and every sandwich to order.  They are good - but you must be willing to wait.I have not yet tried the hot entrees.I am truly thankful that our office has a cafeteria, so I dare not complain too much.

I am visiting NC for the holidays and I just had to try it once I got out here. The idea was just too intriguing.Donuts are a little small but warm which is nice...We ordered a variety.. including lemonade, strawberry shortcake, french toast, trail mix, creamsicle... and more.   See online for the menu and what each of these consists of.  The toppings are really WAY too tooth-achingly sweet for me but I do see the merit in the dip to order format.  It's a lot of fun.  My 4 year old nieces LOVED it...as did my mother and sister.We also ordered some egg sandwiches to start since none of us had eaten breakfast (before the nieces early morning preschool holiday program) and truthfully they left something to be desired.  My egg and cheese on rye was pre-fabbed and not very tasty... as was my dad's egg, sausage and cheese on rye.  The (slight) exception was my mom's ""breakfast club sandwich"" on a bagel, which was piled high with HUGE amounts of thin sliced ham and bacon on top of the (rather pre-fabbed) egg.  It was pretty obnoxious and enough for two people... but tasty.Secretly I do want to try the donut breakfast sandwich, with egg and sausage.  Argh.  Imagine the salty sweet goodness...     but I'm not gonna go there...for fear of my girlish figure.So I guess the bottom line here is that the thing to stick with is the donuts, for a silly treat, and not the breakfast sandwiches.

Televisions.  0_oI'm in town visiting my parents and we heard they had a decent selection of craft beers so we went for lunch to check it out.  Beer selections are diverse and seem to rotate enough to keep it interesting, but our server knew almost nothing about any of the beers and could not help us choose something based on our other preferences.   They would do well to educate their servers better, have them taste the beers and take notes.  My dad and I know a lot about beer so we were fine on our own but how are you going to really sell anything to customers that may be new to the whole craft beer movement?That being said, you can ask for a sample of beers as long as their are not designated as an 11oz pour on the menu.  Why, I don't know.. Again, our server couldn't tell us.Other than that, the food was predictable but good.  Fajitas, burritos, tacos, quesadillas, salads, burgers, sandwiches and wraps.  That sort of thing.   I had the original burger and it had nice chargrilled flavor and a soft buttery bun.  Didn't really need much in the way of condiments.   However, I think it's completely ridiculous that they cannot  cook anything less than medium.  Seriously, is that a law or something?  Lame.  My side salad was large but mostly lettuce...  some variation in vegetables outside of the standard tomato and cucumber would be nice.... but at least it was fresh.  My folks had the wings, and I sampled my moms order since she had the boneless  (I generally think wings are way more trouble than they're worth)...    They were good, and the medium spice was on the hotter side of medium (and rather salty in my opinion).   She had a hard time with them being as spicy as they were.  I probably wouldn't want to eat more than a couple, myself... more due to the salt/tang factor than anything else.    My dad was pretty happy with his regular order of wings and the fries were pretty good and crunchy but again... really salty....  I suppose it goes well with the beer.  Service was attentive aside from our server not being able to guide us toward other beers... and I think the self serve tabletop taps in the bar area are fun (and probably dangerous).    Unfortunately we're unlikely to go back... it just wasn't interesting enough to hold our attention, though it's probably good for game nights and big groups so I'm sure they'll do well.",1,cxA-ETXXXBzOlR83j7feMQ,0,Hbj4GbkftebXnkm_1p7i-g,6/12/2013,2,0,31,8700 Sam Furr Rd,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'loud', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Music': {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'free', 'RestaurantsReservations': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'HappyHour': True, 'GoodForDancing': False, 'BikeParking': True, 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'CoatCheck': False, 'Smoking': 'outdoor'}","['American (New)', 'Bars', 'Restaurants', 'Sports Bars', 'American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife']",Huntersville,"{'Monday': '11:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Friday': '11:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '11:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '11:00-0:00'}",0,35.4428962,-80.8801178,Taco Mac,,28078,72,2.5,NC,Restaurant,North Carolina,Shanna

My reviews are based off my experience being born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area so...   take this for how it relates to you.  I freely admit that I'm a snooty bitch.  So... don't hate...   131 Main vaguely reminds me of a small scale chain in my local area that includes Los Altos Grill (bay area), Rutherford Grill (napa), Houston's (san francisco), and a few more...      Check it out yourself, and tell me it's not practically the same... ( http://hillstone.com/ )...As you can see, 131 has a very similar menu to the Hillstone Group, from the deviled eggs, to the grilled artichoke, right down to the cast iron skillet corn bread....    Roast chicken, steaks. fish, burgers, salads, and sandwiches are the big feature items.    Only 131 is not quite hitting the mark, IMO.   If you've ever been to one of the aforementioned Hillstone restaurants... and then you try 131...  you will feel that 131 is a somewhat poor imitation of the original.   The quality is just not as high, it's not as well executed...   and the service is far too aloof.  Also, there is no free corkage at 131... which is what the Hillstone folks are famous for.. and for the price, 131 should offer no corkage too.     Or at least a better wine list.131 is dimly lit and boothy.  Yes.   But is it ""upscale""?  Absolutely not..   Not by my standards.    Is it a bit spendy?  Somewhat...   but as far as quality and service goes, this restaurant is more along the lines of mid-scale.  That being said.. would I go back?  Sure.. why not...    It's a fine place to eat.

They obliged and there were 5 seats at the sushi bar waiting for us when we got there.The staff here is super friendly and ridiculously fast.  We placed our orders and were eating within minutes.  We started with a scallop appetizer that was served on a pringle chip. Um, yum.  And I also ordered some hot sake to warm me up on this ridiculously cold night.  Speaking of warming me up the truffle lobster miso soup also did the trick and may have well been the yummiest miso soup I've ever had.

(Not Sunday Brunch) Stopped by a local (hotspot) diner to find them closed for the upcoming holiday. Hit another two restaurants discovering that lunch was being served. On a whim, I asked cuzzo to search his phone, somehow he found this gem using Yahoo search! (of all search engines..) The exterior of the restaurant provides little information about what to expect. From the outside, it looks tiny and then the sign indicating it's cash only. (Seriously, it's 2017. We're not in a depressed state any longer and you can eat 1-2% in CC fees for the sake of your customers. This is a time when more often, folks walk around with CCs and some use (NFC pay) Android or iPhone pay services. I once saw a cupcake dealer on a bicycle taking payments via Square on his smartphone. Don't get me started on cash only restaurants with their own foreign ATM. Those fees!)Back home (in Chicago), I am always on the hunt for a decent breakfast burrito. Somewhere, with their own housemade chorizo and with any luck, California style. I spent time living on the West coast and found breakfast burritos to be an anytime Godsend. BC had three versions of breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros! (What?!) I opted for the chorizo burrito and asked if they could stuff breakfast potatoes in there too. The burrito was served with red and green salsa on opposite sides of the plate. Dude... FTW, sooo good!!!I don't usually finish meals. Most times I'll take a portion to go. But this was, to the last fork full, sublime! Cuzzo opted for the Cheese steak Eggs Benedict. (We hit Melt the night before and he'd had the Cheese steak there as well) This guy can eat. There wasn't any sauce left on the plate! With a couple mugs of coffee.. we were set for the day. Since we had family back at the crib, we grabbed some Bfast sliders to-go. (Those were damn good too!)I hope locals keep'em prosperous, next time I'm local a few days, I'd def come back.

You're CRAZY!!!That actually may be a true statement about me, since my mother has never had me tested! But nevertheless, I did not enjoy the charred, ashy flavor of their meats (particularly the ribeye steak sandwich). I didn't add any additional toppings (which might have helped), but I wanted to taste the purity of the meat. Also, the ratio of meat to veggies was ridiculously lopsided with thick cut roasted veggies being probably 70% of the sandwich. Considering the cost of the sandwich, I would have expected more meat.  Although I liked the burger much more, I was not a fan of the hard breads they use to compliment their sandwiches. I also did not enjoy the strong flavor of the roasted potatoes and the beef empanadas were just okay. My tweenage kids took a bite and refused to eat any more of their food. They have a serious dislike for anything that has a burnt flavor and I honestly couldn't argue with them. I love a decent char, but today it was like eating cigarette butts from an ashtray. I felt so bad because I really hyped this place up to them after reading reviews and getting recommendations prior to my visit. So I took them down the street for a bowl of pho to make amends. Another visit may yield a better result, but as a first-time experience goes, the food did not live up to the hype. The restaurant itself, the decor and the staff on the other had were awesome! What an eclectic collection of humans! FINAL THOUGHTSThis place came highly recommended, which makes me dread writing this review. I definitely don't want this to be a slap in the face to all the awesome yelpers who suggested Gaucho as THEE place to visit for my one day trip to Pittsburgh, but I gotta be honest.

My kids hated the super charred flavor of their burgers and rib eye steak sandwich, so I had to quickly find an alternative eating venue to satisfy their teenage hunger. Although Gauchos is Pittsburgh's highest rated restaurant, I must admit I was not a fan, but I was not nearly as disgusted as my kids.  We ate a few bites there and decided to give Vietnam's Pho a try since we'd parked practically right in front of it anyway. Yelp reviews had the overall rating here @ 3.5 stars, so I figured I wouldn't be too disappointed. However, the lack of customers and weirdly abandoned looking entrance made me pause. The entrance looks like the lobby of an old apartment building. You then walk through more doors into another space that serves as their to-go sandwich shop before walking through yet another door into the main dining area. It was dark and totally weird with a fish tank dead smack in the middle of the room, but we were hungry and decided to give it a try anyway. So glad we did!The pho came out piping hot in a nice size bowl. I was immediately impressed that I barely saw any oil droplets on the surface. This is either an indication that they don't cook their broth using beef bones/stock or they meticulously skim the surface to give you the cleanest broth experience possible. Honestly, it may be the former! But that old familiar pho flavor I love was apparent, so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and assume they did the latter.

The fish was fresh and buttery - and I almost felt like I was back in SF for a moment - the flavor was so distinct and delicious.The rest of our party - was just as happy with their meal choices - finding the portions huge, and the quality and flavor - robust.I have to dock a star though for the creme caramel cheescake, which I expected to be a stand-out. Especially since it was touted as being a Bahama Breeze special. It was grossly disappointing for it's off taste - and pricey for six dollars.

After finding ""the one"" my friends spent the night attempting to play beer pong with brawny guys. One green beer after another....one high five after another...one spill after another....one ""hey, watch those hands"" after another.....it all came to a finale  - as my friend turned to me - his face matching the color of his beer and nodded. I understood. I grabbed my other friend, and we tripped over cups and half naked girls to the still snow covered ground outside - and painted it with our St. Patrick's day Guinnesses. YUCK. I was done......The next morning - I was miserable. My friends were already all packed to go, both obviously lacking livers . I was in no such shape. I needed something before I could move, not to mention that all my clothes were ruined from the night before.

""Yeah jess - get dressed - we're going to go to Primanti's.""And so...reluctantly....I put on an absurd outfit in the middle of freezing winter - white legs and all, and climbed into the car to Primanti's.I kept on complaining, in between nauseousness that everyone would stare at my outfit in the middle of the winter weather. ""no Permanti's is cool - they've seen everything.""

This ain't a buffet, and how much oatmeal can one really eat, anyway!? I might just put one of these in my house. *Wonderful coffee and tea offerings served in REAL MUGS if you are hanging out. Not to mention, INTELLIGENTSIA coffee brewed and served. Be still my Chicago-loving heart. *Bright, clean, spacious, cozy: A fireplace, plenty of sturdy tables and chairs.

Maybe slightly moreso than say...Snickers Bar pancakes, but these bad boys were very decadent, topped with mucho butter and pecans and peaches. I mean, really? REALLY!We also split the Ranchero Omelette for some protein, which was fluffy, full of cheese and flavorful. Only complaint was homemade salsa was a bit runny, and wet eggs ick me out.

There was a gang of grandmas on bikes leaving when we walked in. I've  never seen a gang of grandmas on bikes before, so as far as I know these grandmas only eat at Gaucho. Which seems like a strong endorsement.2. The nice young woman behind the counter was wearing a necklace/scarf made of receipt paper, and making it look good. Basically, everyone that works here seems like they enjoy their job, which is always a good sign.3. The menu is full of all the things I want in my life.A few reasons I really, really loved Gaucho AFTER I got my food.1. The Carne Sandwich. This comes with your choice of steak; I went ribeye, which was a juicy, fatty, perfect medium rare, sliced up and slapped onto that amazing bread with char-grilled peppers. If they put more chimichurri on it, it would've been perfect. Luckily, they have jars of chimichurri* available. I put more on, and it was perfect.2. The Paletilla de Cordero. This is a roasted lamb shank with root vegetables in a phenomenal gravy, over grits, with a charred piece of bread to top it off. It is impossible to decide whether this dish was more beautiful or delicious, because it was so beautiful, and so delicious.3. The Gaucho Salad. This fresh and colorful salad is the exact thing to order on top of two disgustingly meaty dishes to make you feel like you didn't beast too hard at lunch. But you did. You really, really did.4. The sauces. Yes, the chimichurri is fantastic and I want to slather it on everything. But don't sleep on the other sauces! This joint knows flavor, and I would gladly drink the ajo, the pimenton, and of course, the always enigmatic quiquirimichi.In case you didn't realize, my list of things I love after I got my food was all of my food. Because all the food here is delicious. Don't miss it.____________*It turns out chimichurri is autocorrected to 'chino hurry.' Which is racist, Apple. But chinos and everyone else should probably hurry to Gaucho before they run out of meat.

This cured beef upstaged a lot of the pork (as we all know, the finest meat to cure) with it's roasted pepper conserva. Plus it all looks damn good, in addition to being tasty.2. The bar program.

There's a drink right now that is made with house-infused porcini mushroom cognac. And I liked it. The food menu also rotates dishes in and out, but if the brussels sprouts are there, do yourself a favor and get them. They are vegetables, and they are goddamn delicious (the cubes of halloumi help). The burger is outstanding, the fries are perfect, and even the salads are worth ordering.

If you arrive before 11 am on a weekday, the breakfast sandwich (add coppa if you know what's good for you) is an excellent choice, and pretty much the only one. The pizza is also good; sausages and hot peppers are a winner of a combo.But I want to talk about the Ham & Cheese. This is not your average sandwich.

I have no such qualms. Of course, you've got to take that with a grain of salt (get it?!!) since I've only been to a few places, but Salt is easily my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant to date.While the communal tables were packed and lively on a Friday evening, we were able to sit down at the bar immediately. I would've preferred a spot watching the open kitchen, but I'll never be sad about sitting at a bar, especially one manned by such talented ladies. Both of us jumped on the bourbon cocktail of the day; with Green Chartreuse and hickory, it was a bit on the sweet side for him, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.The menu on the wall (and only on the wall, no printed copies anywhere) was appealing from top to bottom, and we went meat-heavy with our orders. We started with the steak tartare; a bit of bone marrow, cornichons and a silky quail egg punched up the quality cut, and it was flawless. However, it still paled in comparison to the crispy gnocchi, served with chunks of astonishingly tender beef cheek, all atop an unctuous layer of beef tongue. The light touch of a papaya sauce, along with a bit of the braising liquid, culminated in nothing less than culinary genius. I loved every bite, and if he wasn't my brother, I probably would've broken his face for eating almost half. Since three types of beef weren't enough for him, he also opted for the hanger steak as his main. Served with broccoli kimchi and a wild rice porridge, the beef was once again a winner. The dish was a bit soupier than anticipated, but the dark porridge was a perfect vehicle for the medium rare meat, once again tender as can be. I chose the duck. The perfectly cooked slices of breast were laid over a parsnip puree and accompanied by halusky with onion and apple, a few roasted brussel sprouts and what appeared to be even more braised duck. While it might not be an affordable entree by Pittsburgh standards, you absolutely get your money's worth with each order here. It was a MEAL, and a damn fine one.Throughout dinner, the service was excellent. Our beautiful bartenders were kind enough to keep us in cocktails (a Manhattan for me, complete with a huge, round ice cube) after we finished our initial offerings, and didn't rat me out for stealing huge pieces of steak while my brother was in the bathroom.If I had a complaint, it would be that it's gonna be a bitch to hit up the 'Burgh every time I want to eat here, but I'll be back.",12,e2zO5THDYoDOcyXcWnQv5w,10,WK1MnW6hrL5Eq7TR6ggxAw,2/26/2012,5,8,32,5523 Penn Ave,"{'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'Caters': False, 'HasTV': False, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'BikeParking': True, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}}","['Restaurants', 'American (New)', 'American (Traditional)']",Pittsburgh,"{'Monday': '17:00-23:00', 'Tuesday': '17:00-23:00', 'Friday': '17:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '17:00-23:00', 'Thursday': '17:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '17:00-0:00'}",0,40.4639479,-79.9316099,Salt of the Earth,Garfield,15206,271,4,PA,Restaurant,Pennsylvania,Peter

Lucky for you, he tried to drown me when I was four years old, so I would never let that influence my review. If anything, I would dock them a star or two for employing someone who would so callously throw a toddler into a pond.* But I'm far too levelheaded to let anything like that color my judgment, or to hold a grudge for twenty-something years. Anyway. I could drink here all night. Because I like this bar. 1947 is a simple space. The decor is all dark wood and back-lit bottles, and the vibe is warm and friendly. There's a long bar that runs the length of the space, and as far as I can tell, it's all about the whiskey. I appreciate that they've got at least 25 different bourbons back there, and that the bartenders will mix you a mean Manhattan with any one of them. I haven't had a chance to try any of the food yet, but I did see a man going to town on a burger I gladly would've stolen, and the mac & cheese smelled amazing. Either way, a fireplace and lots and lots of bourbon was all I really wanted anyway.  Although, as a general rule, lots of alcohol and no food can lead to you making an ass out of yourself.

The fries were super soggy, the bread is like a soft white bread, the kind where your fingers make imprints upon touching and the thing was all slaw. The pastrami was ok (my man liked it much more than I did) and the Pitts'burger' was definitely a let down, all I tasted was that slaw and bread. It was cheap for 3 sandwiches the meal rang up to to $21 and some change but, I, who never leaves a plate empty left half of a sammy behind.

One time I went through the drive thru for a cup of coffee and they somehow managed to screw that up.  You might ask ""how do you mess up a cup of coffee?""  The answer is to put five sugars in it instead of three, even though I didn't ask for that many.  I don't care if you think it tastes better that way (which is what she told me when I questioned her on it).

But if possible, this might even top it.  To make matters even more challenging, you almost can't map your way to their front door, so you may get lost in the manufacturing wasteland that surrounds this little gem.  Or end up at Bojangles.  Work through the pain.  It's worth it.We actually went for the Dining in the Dark event, to benefit a charity for the visually challenged.  As such, we didn't get to see much of the place.  At least, not once the blindfolds came down.However, the experience was cool.  It's different than what you see on television through the nightvision cameras.  Those generally don't seem to have you blindfolded for one, or skanky hos doing nasty things when they think no one is watching.  But as we were actually there with other diners, the blindfolds were required.  It also gave the ""normals"" something to laugh at.  Sort of a built-in entertainment if you will.I can't really say much about the service, as I didn't drink much of my water, not wanting to spill it on myself, the people I dined with, the table or the floor.  So the glass may very well have been empty the entire time.  The whole process did seem to go a bit slow - though that could have been because they were trying to serve twenty blindfolded people and talk them through their meal while keeping up with regular diners as well.As to the food, it was really good.  I just wish there was more of it.  When you're dining and concentrating only on the food, it's so much better.  It may have not looked like much - or it may even have looked outstanding - but it tasted phenomenal.  I am sure that I ate things that I may not even have ordered in a normal setting, and I probably looked ridiculous doing so, but I enjoyed the process immensely.Finally found the menu, and it consisted of oxtail-stuffed ravioli, veal strip loin with ostrich pate, purple peruvian potatoes and a lemoncello pancetta on almond shortdough.

We ordered the appetizer combo ($14), which included hummus, olive tapenade, Carrot Delight, and a slightly spicy red pepper dip. For entrees, our group was evenly split between Turkish and Mediterranean. I loved my beef shish kebab, especially the flavorful rice, which sort of reminded me of dim sum sticky rice. The yogurt sauce was envied by my calzone-ordering tablemates, although they were very happy with their giant calzones. The house salad comes with a tangy lemony vinaigrette that's really good and worth trying.We came in fairly late, an hour before closing, when there was only one other table. Soon we were the only table, and from then on we were kind of obsessively stalked by our server, who was popping in every two minutes to refill the bread, ask if we needed anything else at all, and generally hurry us out the door. I didn't care for that part so much - if you're open till 9, you're open till 9. Quit bugging us about the damn bread.In addition to the shish kebab and some veggie Turkish dishes, there's also a sprinkling of traditional pasta dishes, a few salads, and individual pizzas. Prices ranged from $12-16 for dinner entrees, and it looked like they also did some pizza delivery or takeout at the counter.

We did get some cheese curds from a place a Wisco lad said was the absolute best (but I'd had better when a friend brought back the dill curds from another vendor at the very same fair), but other than that, it was really just a fair for plants and people selling radishes and rhubarb. How many things can you make out of radish and rhubarb as the main ingredient? Is this a Wisco thing? Because I don't think we Illini have put much stock in the dietary nourishment of radishes and rhubarb as a main ingredient.I guess after having been to farmers market out in the SoCal area, it's probably hard to compare, but is this one really all that much superior to other farmer's markets?

Defo NOT what you're expecting or wanting when you order a porter.We dined with another couple in the upstairs pizzeria... I think going upstairs was not a great idea as it was empty, less one guy at the 'bar' and a staff that looked barely legal to be serving beer. For 2 couples, who ordered one round of beers and 2 pizzas, the number of mistakes made by the restaurant became almost comical until the bill came and we were still not appropriately compensated for the excessive amount of time wasted waiting for them to attempt to make our make our food correctly, which they still ended up not doing. First mistake: The other couple ordered the large Thai Pie pizza, veggie style (no chicken, sub pineapple) and requested for one half of that to be made w/o cheese and noted that it was because one of the diners is lactose intolerant. When that pizza came, the server acknowledged that pizza had been made incorrectly, with only half being the veggie Thai Pie and the other half being only cheese, which obvi wouldn't work for the lactose intolerant diner. She said they were making her up a new smaller pizza that was the Thai Pie as she requested. Second mistake: After looking closer at what was on the Thai Pie portion of the above pizza, they realized that they had also not gotten half the ingredients that were meant to come on the Thai Pie. No shredded carrots, no cilantro, nada. When we let the server know she brought it back to the kitchen area and had the kid toss some shredded carrots and cilantro on top. Third mistake: Our pizza arrives well after the other couple's first pizza at the table had arrived (what was the hold up with ours? Can they not make 2 pizzas at once?). We had ordered the large Thai Pie as well, veggie style (no chicken, sub basil). The server dropped the pie off and swiftly left. As we looked at the pizza, we noticed that there was no basil and there was chicken. Since neither of us eat meat, this was obvi not going to fly. We had to AGAIN get up, find the server, tell here the issue and wait for her to come back for the old pizza. They said they'd make us up a correct one right away. Fine, no prob, I worked in restaurants for well over a decade, I've had sh*tty days and I know there are times when it seems like a chain of everyone is messing up one table's order. Fourth mistake: Our pizza FINALLY comes, after he other couple is done with both their first and second round of incorrect pizzas and just waiting on us. We check out the pizza and not only did they bring us the small sized pizza, instead of the large that we had ordered, but there still was no basil, and they added pineapple. So apparently they remade the other couple's first half of the pizza they ordered. Whatever. Fuck it. We're all hungry, we have a long drive back, I'll pick the f*cking pineapple off the pizza. Another person at our table went to ask for a side of basil to add so at least we could have that, but it was still some kind of bullsh*t that they still could not manage to make a single pizza correctly, when there was only 1 table in there eating.

Everyone at the table had all or does still work or manage a restaurant so we understood and she just checked to see if everything ""at least tastes okay"" and said she'd take care of some of our bill, but when the bill came for the BF and I we were still charged the full price for our drinks and she had only mildly discounted the price of a large Thai Pie, when we still had only received a small one. So basically, she cut us a deal on *maybe* $3 after we had been sitting there getting the wrong sh*t for the past 2 hours, and then, to top it off, she blamed everything on the poor server girl. Using her name and saying she was new and making a face. As a former server, I thought this was totally inappropriate. For that many mistakes to happen it's not only the server, but the kitchen, and now, in my opinion, the manager's fault.

The back of the menu lists the many local farms that L'Etoile uses to produce its contemporary fine dining cuisine and the freshness and quality really come across.  A lot of their produce burst with flavor and freshness that is easy to find in California but difficult to find elsewhere.In addition to the fresh ingredients, L'Etoile utilizes a lot of premium ingredients like chanterelles, high quality prosciutto, buttery and velvety foie gras, and grass fed, dry aged beef. The kitchen also shows great versatility whether it is a fresh and vibrant salad like their tomato, cantaloupe, arugula, and prosciutto salad, an intense and refined fine dining dish like their foie gras with sweet corn, chanterelles and blueberry gastrique or a hearty Midwestern dish like their New York Strip with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and bearnaise.I enjoyed all the savory courses I had.  Their cantaloupe in their starter salad had a great sweetness and the aftertaste of that fruit was mellowed out.  In addition, the dish was one of the menu items utilizing Asian ingredients (the head chef Tory Miller has an Asian heritage).  The cantaloupe was marinated like kimchi to provided a nice spiciness.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#1Dm_XzeFUsGbh-7ea6UYpwThe seared foie gras was very good--buttery and creamy on the inside and a slightly crispy exterior.  All of the garnishes stood out--earthy chanterelles, very sweet summer corn and a sweet and tart blueberry gastrique.  I think the dish could have benefitted from brioche, a crumble or a streusel because of the creaminess of the dish.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#kZci-HIMA6X0QDqBEI8hxwThey do beef very well here.  They source from a farm that dry ages their beef. L'Etoile then performs additional dry aging.  With dry aging, you can make the meat more flavorful but which can sacrifice juiciness.  That was not the case here.  Despite being a New York Strip and being dry aged, the meat was very tender and juicy.The meat also had a really strong beef flavor, which you do not always get (even with good beef).  The outside crust was also good--slightly crisp and very flavorful.  The side of mashed potatoes was also very good--rich and very thick (like good French pomme purxc3xa9e).  The other sides (like overcooked shiitake mushrooms) were very ordinary--the kind of food you would get at a run of the mill steakhouse.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#X9QeW2cMEXDG8iUldS1h1QFor cheeses, they feature 30 varieties of cheese from Wisconsin.  I did not love the cow's milk cheese I had, but it was more because it was not my kind of cheese.  I like softer and creamier cheeses.  The cheese did have a complex flavor--nutty like gouda but also with salty Parmesan notes.  The garnishes were great--really flavorful and crisp walnut toast, spicy hazelnuts and a really good fruit paste of cherries and berries.For dessert, I had their warm polenta cake with blueberry compote.  The cake was good as was the blueberry topping.  The garnishes did not work though.  I liked the caramel corn but the regular corn (not treated in any way to produce a different texture) just did not work as a dessert. The sour cream and blueberry sorbet was icy and tart.  And given that the polenta cake was not incredibly sweet or rich, I think a good ice cream would have been the better way to go.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#VYKnzdgfn2KDV7hMZcgsgQService was excellent.  My server Jessica was very personable, polite and polished.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu, which made me very confident on what I was ordering.  Despite the many courses, the food came out at a very even pace.Prices are high at L'Etoile, but the quality is very good and portions on several items are very generous.L'Etoile occupies a very nice space. The room is elegant but also contemporary and the huge windows allow a lot of great natural light to fill the room as well as allow patrons to view Madison's picturesque and lively capital square.I have not dined at many restaurants in Wisconsin, but I would imagine that L'Etoile has to be one of the very best.  It is one of the best Midwestern restaurants I have been to outside of Chicago.  With its focus on local farms, Wisconsin cheese, high quality beef, and contemporary cooking techniques/styles, L'Etoile is a great restaurant to experience cuisine that reflects both the chef's formal training at great restaurants as well as the high quality food that the midwest has to offer.Parking via pay lots/structures is available.",20,ubEa6XiMt6gOJ9xsUkbpEw,15,PalFBSjGAhs73L2UO31QxQ,11/28/2013,5,11,153,1 S Pinckney St,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'quiet', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'dressy', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': True, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'no', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'BYOB': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'DogsAllowed': False, 'BikeParking': True, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 4, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'RestaurantsCounterService': False}","['American (New)', 'Restaurants']",Madison,"{'Monday': '17:30-0:00', 'Tuesday': '17:30-21:00', 'Friday': '17:30-22:00', 'Wednesday': '17:30-21:00', 'Thursday': '17:30-21:00', 'Saturday': '17:00-22:00'}",1,43.07528946,-89.38236003,L'Etoile,Capitol,53703,223,4.5,WI,Restaurant,Wisconsin,Anthony

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.Unfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).The breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.This Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.This Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.On weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).The front desk was nice and helpful.Room rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.This Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.This Marriott has its own free parking lot.

I carted a box of baked goods through security, stepped onto the plane and gingerly places it in the overhead (I was sitting in the first row, otherwise I would have put it under my seat.) Through all of this travel the loaf remained in perfect condition. I brought it home to Sir Nicholas and Little Man E would both took bites and make various sounds of approval. In Nick's case it was something like, ""man, this is sooo good!"" while Ephraim took a bite, giggled maniacally and took off down the hallway with as big a piece as he could hold.

While in Madison this week- I had a chance to experience what everyone told me was the ""best restaurant in the city"".  In my opinion- it was good, not great and the service needs work.Harvest has a great location right across from the Capitol within walking distance of the downtown hotels.  It's store front simplicity must surprise a lot of people as the night we were there- there were no less than 5 tables that got seated, looked at the menu, apologized and then walked out.  It's my belief that the name ""Harvest"" makes people think its some type of an organic sandwich shop when instead it is a white table cloth dining experience with a menu that includes a 6 course ""tasting"" paired with wines or a more traditional menu.The food is good.  The chef sent out a ""muse"" of lettuce soup.  Yep- I said lettuce and that is what is tasted like.  Wasn't crazy about it, but half the fun of eating out is trying new things.  We ordered a variety of first courses from the tuna tartar (very good) to the duck prosciutto (good) to the Caesar wrap (not so good, yet it was the server's recommendation- very strange)  The Caesar wrap was like  small bits of rolled pastry around lettuce served with an anchovy on top and some sauce.  Not the best thing on the menu.The main courses were very good.  We had the halibut, the hamachi (covered in foam and served with fava beans) and the crawfish lasagna made with spinach noodles.  For dessert we split the berry crumble (very sour) but good.As for the service- it was nonexistent.  In fact- I might suggest that our server get a new career for herself.  She was unpersonable, didn't know the menu and seemed to always be a beat off.  We got more help from the busgirl who seemed very eager to help us out.  Very strange for a restaurant of that caliber.Reasonably priced (at least by Chicago standards) the 6 course tasting menu was only $55 and the accompanying wines were another $25.  On the regular menu, the average entree was about $25.So, bottom line?  It was good food, served in a very nice downtown location.  As for the service- if they get that right- I might give it another star.",0,cMybOpJd352Cb6y9SeVhPw,0,Zr7EpNDDOth-cVDOrGXoJg,6/8/2007,3,0,54,21 N Pinckney St,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'dressy', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Music': {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'no', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'HappyHour': False, 'GoodForDancing': False, 'BikeParking': True, 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'CoatCheck': True, 'Smoking': 'no', 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Nightlife', 'Restaurants', 'Bars', 'American (New)']",Madison,"{'Monday': '17:30-21:00', 'Tuesday': '17:30-21:00', 'Friday': '17:00-21:00', 'Wednesday': '17:30-21:00', 'Thursday': '17:30-21:00', 'Saturday': '17:00-21:00'}",1,43.0760472,-89.3838053,Harvest,Capitol,53703,200,3.5,WI,Restaurant,Wisconsin,Carol

So after debating between a couple of choices- we chose to go to the Ocean Grill- a sleek contemporary restaurant that was voted the best seafood restaurant in Madison in 2006.Too bad the weather didn't cooperate as I would have liked to have sit outside on their patio area.  Oh well- we did get a nice table by the windows to enjoy our dinner.This restaurant prides itself on its 26 varieties of sparking wine which makes them Madison's premiere champagne bar.  Not in the mood for champagne?  They have a great wine list with over 25 wines available by the glass.We started with fresh oysters (2 varieties), fried calamari with a peanut sauce and an interesting goat cheese coated with nuts and honey and served with fruit. All were delicious- a perfect way to start our evening.The entrees were where it fell apart a little for me.  While the grouper sounded wonderful- coated with horseradish and served with wasabi mashed potatoes and stir fried vegetables- in reality, the fish was bland and over cooked and the vegetables were almost greasy.  The other entree was a grilled swordfish which was good but unremarkable.They did redeem themselves with the desserts.  We tried two- the molton chocolate cake and the poundcake with creme fraiche and berries.  While the chocolate cake was the winner- both were very good.Service was attentive and they did take one of the grouper entrees off the bill as it was basically untouched.  The manager also came over to apologize saying that she ""wanted us to love it"".  All in all- a solid choice for seafood in Madison.  Just stick to the simpler things on the menu and you will be fine.

We did both- ordering fresh oysters, xinxin and soft shelled crab off the tapas menu, and then our entrees of salmon and steak off the regular menu.The oysters were from Vancouver and New Zealand tonight.  They were ok but were lacking that fresh salty flavor of my preferred East Coast oysters.  Interested in knowing what xinxin is?  Well it's kind of a stew with shrimp, chicken, chorizo and beef in a coconut milk sauce and cashews.  Very odd combination of flavors, I am still not sure if I liked it.  Hands down, the soft shell crab was the best thing of the night- served over a salad with mustard dressing and roasted tomatoes.The entrees were pretty to look at but there was a lot going on and the flavors were almost too complex.  The salmon had a shellfish mousse on top and was served with corn and a black bean relish.  My rib eye steak was served with warm potato salad and coated with a spicy sauce that was almost BBQ like.  The wine list is pretty extensive with a wide range of wines by the glass.  Service was spotty as the place was packed and we often had to flag our server down and this was on a Monday night!If I were to go again- I'd probably just grab a table on the outdoor patio or at the bar- and enjoy a glass of wine with some of their amazing bread and their selection of Spanish cheeses.  And with the live jazz playing in the background, I'd be in the perfect place.

We wandered around with an old phone number and address until a local saw us pass him for the 3rd time and told us that they had moved. Turns out that move was two years ago to a contemporary spot with a sushi bar, intimate seating indoors and a great outdoor patio. I sure don't understand why the convention bureau still shows this place at another location but maybe they'll read this and get it together. Anyway-once you find it, I think you'll be impressed. We were seated in the front windows and decided to go with sushi rather than the Asian fusion part of the menu. Our rolls arrived quickly, with the favorites being the rainbow and the spicy tuna. The fish was fresh, and the display was artful.  They have an extensive sake list as well. The service was great; friendly and quick with plenty of useful suggestions and even an apology for our having to wander around looking for the place (it is a little understated on the outside) Dinner for two with plenty of drinks ran about $85 which was reasonable given the large quantity and quality of the food.

But if you are a trivia nut like me- Brocach is Irish for Badger Den- now how appropriate is that for a bar located in downtown Madison home of the Wisconsin Badgers??! On the night we were here -it was hot and humid. We opted to sit outside with an excellent view of the Capital but until the sun went down, it was pretty warm. The patio consists of 6 or so bistro tables but check inside with the host first if you plan to sit out there. Inside- there is a long, dark wood bar and plenty of tables between the two rooms. We ordered beer and a Meze platter which was basically two kinds of hummus, warm pita points, feta cheese and a small artichoke and tomato salad. Perfect for a hot night although hardly Irish. But if Irish food is what you want- they have it here. Shepard's pie, Fish and Chips, Bangors and Mash, Irish stew- all the favorites are on the menu. They also have a wide range of imported beers, and a good selection of unusual Irish and Scotch whiskeys. According to the bartender- they also have Irish music on select nights.

It must have worked because on my very next business trip to Phoenix, I decided to take a detour toward Scottsdale to find this place. It honestly looked like a sterile corporate business park upon approach, which should come as no surprise since it was founded by Robert J. Ulrich, the former CEO and Chairman of the Target Corporation. What was surprising was how cavernous this place is inside with over 6,600 musical instruments on display broken out geographically.My 4th grade music teacher, Miss Nelson, would have loved this place since she forced me to play ""Greensleeves"" on the autoharp in front of my class. Covering over 200,000 square feet, the museum starts with an impressive gallery of guitars in a semicircular room (photo: http://bit.ly/2zWa5bE) followed by a room of musical instruments which appear to be a sneak preview of what you're about to see on the second floor (photo: http://bit.ly/2AEkp4q). A long escalator ride upward takes you to the Geographic Galleries where you walk through five cavernous rooms representing the major regions of the world. In each room, there are unique instruments that represent each country in that region. Yes, every country has its own section.Through a wireless guidePORT you're given at the front desk, you basically walk up to any exhibit with a video running, and you can listen to that performance as you approach it because the headphones are activated automatically. Needless to say, you should take your time perusing these rooms because each exhibit provides a fascinating insight into that country's culture (photo: http://bit.ly/2icRWM7). Despite the exotic sights and sounds found in most of the rooms, the United States/Canada gallery is the largest with special sections devoted to the electric guitar, Steinway pianos, rap, country, Hawaiian music, and even a miniature symphony orchestra in a lucite display case (photo: http://bit.ly/2yBxL0T).Once done with the Geographic Galleries, you walk down a spiral staircase back to the first floor where you can enter the Artist Gallery. Here you find exhibits dedicated to musical icons ranging from Elvis (photo: http://bit.ly/2yBy9wn) to Carlos Santana (photo: http://bit.ly/2jm9R6y) to Taylor Swift. I wanted to visit the Experience Gallery, but it was closed when I visited and appeared to be focused more on kids anyway. That's my one minor criticism, the lack of opportunities for adults to interact with some of the more popular instruments like they allow in Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture (review: http://bit.ly/2lkGq5q) or LA's Grammy Museum (review: http://bit.ly/2mlxEVk). Regardless, this is one truly impressive collection well worth visiting if you happen to be in Phoenix.",15,wWhq9cKLCrZHcp-ezp-hPQ,13,jI5X6IN925nzqSSV9mzCEQ,11/14/2017,5,7,27,4725 E Mayo Blvd,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'HasTV': False, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'CoatCheck': True, 'NoiseLevel': 'quiet', 'HappyHour': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'Music': {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'BikeParking': True, 'Smoking': 'no', 'Ambience': {'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': True, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}, 'OutdoorSeating': False, 'GoodForKids': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'GoodForDancing': False, 'Alcohol': 'none'}","['Music Venues', 'Shopping', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Art Galleries', 'Museums', 'Nightlife']",Phoenix,"{'Monday': '9:00-17:00', 'Tuesday': '9:00-17:00', 'Friday': '9:00-17:00', 'Wednesday': '9:00-17:00', 'Thursday': '9:00-17:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-17:00', 'Saturday': '9:00-17:00'}",1,33.66752527,-111.9784432,Musical Instrument Museum,,85050,400,4.5,AZ,Shopping,Arizona,Ed

There was always a data center to visit or a service team or a group of programmers. In fact, the last time I was here strictly for pleasure was a childhood trip that my dad made us take in the Rambler station wagon. Our usual custom was to stay at a Rodeway Inn with a slide next to the pool, and I probably complained about the dry heat in a constant whine that drove my parents nuts. Now the dry heat doesn't bother me as much, and I decided to stay an extra day, Saturday, to see what I have been missing in Phoenix all these years. Someone at work suggested I stop here in the morning since it was fairly close to the part of downtown I was staying.Early for a change, I found myself walking around the open-air market as people were setting up their tables and tents. Fresh produce was plentiful but so was plenty of other food from homemade tamales at The Tamale Store (photo: http://bit.ly/2wajg55) to freshly baked loaves of bread from Jerusalem Bakery (photo: http://bit.ly/2gh2pZ4). Fully ripened tomatoes appeared to be a favorite item here, and Abby Lee Farms had immaculately arranged basketfuls to sell (photo: http://bit.ly/2whvhUQ). There were also non-edible goods like flowers, beeswax and wooden toddler toys (photo: http://bit.ly/2xFC8He).

Oh yeah, I'm in the mood for a good workout and decided to walk around one of Arizona's huge outlet malls. Of all the malls/outlets I've visited, I actually like the Arizona Mills mall. The outlet is obviously much bigger than the Petaluma Outlet Mall. Much more colorful than the one in Gilroy. And despite me being here on a weekday around noon, this nicely-architect outlet is much more livelier than the Great Mall in Milpitas with more and better shops to get lost in.In the mall, there are six different entry ways. Automatically you can tell this outlet is big and already a workout. Each entry way has a sensor of a voice-recording of a man welcoming you to the mall. Sounds creepy, huh?The anchor businesses of the mall are Sport's Authority, Ross, Burlington, Marshall's, Sak's, Neiman Marcus, & Sears Appliance outlet. The anchor restaurants are Johnny Rocket's, Joe's Crab, El Pollo loco and Claim Jumper. I wish I knew about Claim Jumper prior and before my breakfast beforehand.  And for your entertainment, there are an arcade center and AMC theaters with also IMAX-screeningThere are a ton of retail businesses from this mall. And some of the places I've saw and shopped are Border's Discount, Sanrio, Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Oakley, Vans, Crocs, Samsonite, Aeropostale, Animal Kingdom, Levi's, Pink, Radio Shack, Charlotte Russe, F21, Eddie Bauer, Guess, Bebe, Disney Store, Tommy Hilfiger, Victoria Secret, Spencer's, Izod, Sunglasses Hut, Reebok and Nike Outlet Store (obviously, I went and shopped here). That is only a fraction of the mall I saw and shopped. Guess, I'm getting old and can't walk around outlet as big as here no more. But wait there is the food court with a Sbarro, Starbucks, Paradise Bakery, Nathan's Hot Dog, BK, Panda Express, Hana Grill, and Subway. And for a cool treat to beat the desert heat, there is also a Yo-Yo's Frozen Yogurt place (I'll review later).

In the past six plus years since my initial review, I've been extremely loyal to The Root.  I've lost track of the number of times I've visited, and I've seen a handful of stylists but I cannot think of one time that I left the salon not feeling beautiful.  Five star experiences consistently... you don't find that very often!Since my last review, the salon also moved locations, just a tad bit south of their original location.  The new space is awesome.  It has a great, friendly vibe and it's super high tech.  Everyone that works there is friendly and easy to talk to... they really do live by the values on their website: relationships, creativity, fun, learning, humor, hard work, happiness and respect.I typically go in for a cut and standard color (ever since the greys started coming in), but I once got a pink streak in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, and I've gotten a brow wax and a make-up application at The Root as well.  They have plenty of services to offer... my husband has been in for both hair cuts and beard trims too!As mentioned above, I've been loyal to TRS, but I've seen a handful of stylists.  I trust anyone that Laurxc3xa9n hires, and I usually just book ahead with whom ever can accommodate my often busy schedule.  In addition to Laurxc3xa9n herself, I've seen Jillian and Dana, Desiree and Forest, and have been pleased every time.  Huge shout-out to Forest whom I saw most recently for the perfect color job and double french braid I requested at the last minute instead of a blow-out.  She is seriously a braiding expert.  It was perfect!I left the salon and headed to my kids' T-Ball game where I got a ton of compliments on my braids.  It then lasted through dinner, a night of sleep, and a hot yoga class the next day!

Most department stores have a very limited stock and Target doesn't even sell them until January.  #2 - bathing suit shopping is never fun especially during holiday season when workouts get cut short and holiday parties with endless amounts of food and drinks replace them.So, I was on a mission to find a new bathing suit for an upcoming vacation and I was not looking forward to it.  A friend of mine suggested 'Exquisite Swimwear' so I decided to check it out.  I'd seen the cute bathing suits in the window before but this was my first time going in.I received a warm welcome when I entered the store and later learned that the owner (Pauline) was who it came from.  I looked around on my own first and admired all the cute suits, accessories, cover ups, and more... then I felt a bit overwhelmed so I asked for her help.  When I told Pauline what styles and colors I prefer, she pulled a bunch of suits for me to try on... I narrowed it down to two suits and she was very honest in telling me which one she liked better.  (I hate it when you are shopping and the person helping you is not honest!)Needless to say, I walked out with a new suit, so it was a productive trip... I was impressed with the store, the selection, and even the fact that in the dressing rooms, they offer disposable panties to try on suits with... of course the suits have hygienic liners as well, but this was an added bonus.  I was tempted by the clothing, headbands, sandals, and more, but I was on a mission for a bathing suit, so that's what I got!I totally recommend Exquisite Swimwear to anyone looking for a new bathing suit.

They refer to themselves as ""a modern boutique with vintage charm,"" and I'd say that's super accurate!  With super friendly owner and staff, really quirky and fun merchandies, and a super convenient location, this place is great.Whether it's clothing, shoes, candles, accessories of all sorts, or just a greeting card, Frances has it all.  This boutique is conveniently located right at Central and Camelback and has a nice big parking lot right there.  So unless it is time for one of their events like Crafeteria, parking in the lot isn't an issue.It's worth it to find other parking for Crafeteria though... It's always held in early December - perfect for holiday shopping!  There are tons of unique local artists, live music, and even some food trucks.  This year, we swung by and purchased some great candles amongst other things.  It's just a lot of fun to support local and see others doing the same.

We stopped by this morning to find lots of passionate business owners and employees, fellow shoppers, and some food, drink, and entertainment as well.UNION is made up of 18 small boutiques ranging in size from 200-500 square feet, as well as the new casual eatery, Trattoria del Piero. It's located at the east end of the outdoor shopping mall, right next door to Stingray.  We had our toddler with us, so I couldn't do as much shopping as I would've liked today, but I'll definitely be back to explore in more detail.  In the meantime, some highlights for me included seeing several fabulous women's boutiques near the front that I didn't catch the names of; a small storefront for Customatic.com, which offers all kinds of custom pieces for the modern home; Smeeks which sells an assortment of old-time favorite candy and fun unique gifts - my son was in heaven looking around at everything there; Frances which just like their original location sells everything from women's clothing, shoes, accessories, and more; Oils and Olives by Queen Creek Olive Mill, which is pretty self-explanatory,and Paris Envy which has all kinds of vintage home decor items, accessories, and more.  In addition, there is a flower shop, a bicycle company, a newsstand and paper-goods storefront, Royal Coffee, etc... Like I said, I can't wait to go back without my kid to shop more peacefully and take my time checking it all out!We did grab a quick meal at Trattoria del Piero, which has an impressive menu and serves local, organic food / drinks all day long including casual breakfast and lunch, and more of a full service restaurant in the evenings for dinner.  We had a breakfast frittata sandwich that reminded me of tortilla espanola from my studies abroad in Spain years ago... it was delicious!  We also had a P, B & J sandwich with banana and some mini chocolate cupcakes made with Queen Creek Olive Mill's olive oil - all very tasty!

Unfortunately, when I went to do some research on local cooking classes, most of them were way out of our budget.  That is, until I spoke to Marti at Sweet Basil.  Marti was extremely accommodating and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the pricing for our group was reasonable compared to some of the other cooking schools that I was looking into.  There was a great selection of menus to choose from as well.  I went with the ""Easy Entertaining"" option, which included recipes for the following items:* Baked Brie with Shallots & Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce* Smoked Salmon Cakes with Lemon Dill Aioli* Grilled chicken Satay with Ginger Mustard Sauce* Bloody Mary Shrimp* Pork Pot Stickers with Garlic Soy* Pepper-Crusted Steak with Horseradish cream* Mini Caramel Pecan Pies with Bourbon whipped CreamWhen the group arrived, there were aprons for all, and Marti introduced herself and Chef Linda prior to us beginning.  Our group was ready to get our hands dirty right away, but we did have to be patient as Chef Linda walked us through each recipe... From there, we buddied up (except for Emi H who bravely took on the Chicken Satay on her own) and were on our own with the large kitchen and ingredients.  Tiffany and I did the Brie which was by far the easiest, but we had fun with it and it turned out incredibly (if I can say so myself)!All in all, this was a fabulous evening, and great for team building too... but if you do book Sweet Basil, a couple of things to keep in mind that may be helpful:*While SB does provide iced tea and water, they allow BYOB, so if your group is anything like mine, I do recommend taking advantage and bringing some wine!*You'll likely begin your class promptly at 6:30, but won't be digging into the food for quite some time, so you may want to grab a bite prior to arriving or ask about purchasing some snacks to nosh on while you eat.In addition to the above, note that SB is also a fabulous store for all kinds of cookware, kitchen accessories, and more...

Also, since the location of the store is in the Biltmore Fashion Park, they offer free classes every Sunday at 10:30am that are open to the public.  How cool is that?  I will have to go sometime for sure!  Oh, and extra bonus - I think this store is going to be starting a running group soon too!When I go into lulu stores, I feel like a kid in a candy store... there are all kinds of colorful merchandise from sports bras and tops to shorts, pants, dresses, yoga mats, headbands, and oh so much more.

So, on the last day of 2009, I decided to go spend some of that money and buy something sexy to wear for NYE!Unfortunately, the employees were not helpful at all and the store was a zoo... filled with shoppers because of their sale.  I hunted through and found a few things but didn't have the patience to try stuff on, so I picked out five cute bottoms that were on the 5 for $25 table, a cute night shirt and boy short bottoms, and a couple of other things.  I waited in line and the lady who rang me up tried to sell me on their Angel card.  No thanks I said.  ""Are you sure?"" She asked and proceeded to tell me all about the wonderful benefits of the Angel Card.  ""Not today, thanks"" was my reply.Then she told me one of the bottoms I chose was on sale and no longer part of the 5 for $25 deal.  So I went to choose another pair.  When she told me the same thing about another pair, I'd had enough.  I didn't need eight new pairs of underwear... at that point I was annoyed and chose only a few of the original ones I liked.  I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there.Sure, VS is an alright store, but they need to work on their customer service at this location.  They do sell cute stuff but I'm not so sure about the quality.  I'd much rather prefer shopping at a lingerie boutique but VS is more affordable than most cute higher quality boutiques so I'm sure I'll be back to spend the rest of my gift card money another time soon.  I'll hopefully pick a time to go next time that is not as crazy crowded and perhaps maybe even find a different location where the sales people are pleasant to deal with... I'm sure I could find a push-up bra, t-shirt bra, magic this, or special that... I know they sell something for women of all shapes and sizes.  :)Oh, and if you're wondering, I did wear my purchase on NYE and it worked like a charm - for that, I'm bumping up their two stars to three.

Sharing the same, luxurious theme as its neighbor, it may share a bridge and various restaurants and such, but rest assured the Encore is very much its own property.A recipient of the latest AAA 5 Diamond, it joins a very small handful of hotel establishments throughout Vegas. This basically means Encore has distinction of calling itself one of the most sophisticated, scintillating hotel properties in the world. An establishment that skimps on nothing less than decadent and showcases nothing but the finest. From its sleek exterior to its posh interior, there is no doubt this is a winner for Steve Wynn.With 63 floors, the Encore is actually marginally taller than the Wynn and features a ton of space for casino, retail, hotel, and convention purposes. Like many of the casino resorts along the strip, there is almost plenty of options in every direction though at the Encore, there is less of a need to exit in the name of seeing, eating, and doing. They really do have it all.Room accommodations are impressive from lowest standard two bed room to the ultra high end, massive suites for players. Wynn has invested so much to ensure the comfort levels in every room meet the high standards that most people have for this place. Personally, it comes down to the bed for me. I've never slept better.The casino side isn't nearly as impressive as the Wynn. There seem to be some elements of Wynn Macau here, but on a whole the ambiance of gaming isn't for me anyways, a large selling point. Boutique casinos have a way of keeping the experience intimate for particular gamblers, but the feeling here is no different than like its Palazzo rival.On the nightlife front, is there a better and more celebrated club than XS? For years, my favorite spot was La Bete, which later turned into Tryst (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tryst-nightclub-las-vegas-2) but now XS takes the cake. XS alone probably brings in more visitors than any club in Vegas and amongst the younger nightlife inspired crowd, is potentially the number one reason folks end up paying Encore a visit.Folks looking for a different eating experience will certainly find it at Sinatra (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sinatra-las-vegas) and the same goes for the clubby yet foodie ambiance of Andrea's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas). Wazuzu (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wazuzu-las-vegas) is kind of like an overpriced Asian fusion diner, which is totally skippable in the Encore experience. I personally enjoy every meal at Society Cafe Encore (http://www.yelp.com/biz/society-cafe-encore-las-vegas-5) but that's just me. The line up of eateries may not be impressive compared to its casino counterparts, but at least the places featured are quality.Lastly, I think Encore would be the ultimate property if famous Vegas performer Danny Gans were still alive today. When he was set to perform at Encore as his new home 4 years ago, he was also featured on what was at the time the largest freestanding marquee in the world. Garth Brooks is certainly no slouch, but Gans and his already bustling LV fame would've been the city's top featured act.While I don't think Encore lives up to the same standard as its bigger sister, it is still among the best on the strip for everything it offers. There is no losing scenario when it comes to staying here - it is still worth it for its location, name, and all that it has to offer.",10,Az_60nNuh1FH8Ds8oasZjw,7,lePNDagp9AyIwEGM7iUgWQ,10/18/2013,4,1,45,3131 Las Vegas Blvd S,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'WiFi': 'paid', 'GoodForKids': False}","['Resorts', 'Home & Garden', 'Casinos', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Home Decor', 'Hotels', 'Shopping', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Event Planning & Services']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.12768447,-115.1674461,Encore,The Strip,89109,1726,4,NV,Shopping,Nevada,Jando

Even 4 years after its inception, it can still be debated on whether the turmoil that lead to erecting this massive collection of properties was worth it.There were a number of issues, which could directly be attributed to timing, bad management, and financial handling that kept delayed construction and its eventual opening in 2009. For instance, 6 people died in the construction of the site, prompting a strike from the workers who were concerned for their safety after working on the project for what was then a non-stop 24 hour schedule. Then there was the 2008 world recession, which left a virtual hole in the Strip, leading to a major decline in tourism and money for the city. Delays ensued when the Dubai folks decided to sue their joint venture partners MGM for a breach of contract. Let's not forget that after it opened, it failed to land much fanfare for almost two years the rash (pun intended) of sunburning incidents due to the construction of the Vdara reflecting beams from the sun? After initial estimates of 4 billion to complete the project, the subsequent total cost was more than double, at a cool 9 billion dollars.There is still The Harmon, a tower that was meant to be a boutique non-gaming resort that has never opened to the public. Halted after realizing there were major construction defects during the building process, it has been OK'd for demolition which is likely to happen later in the year or in 2014.Whether it was worth 9 billion or not, the general makeup of CityCenter is aesthetically pleasing. The Veer Towers (http://www.yelp.com/biz/veer-towers-las-vegas) are a nice high rise living option on the Strip to those who can afford it. In all of its sunburning glory, the Vdara (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vdara-las-vegas-2) is a pretty non-gaming hotel and the Mandarin Oriental (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mandarin-oriental-las-vegas-las-vegas) is one of the nicest resorts in the United States, let alone Las Vegas. There are eyeballs widening from all corners for Crystals (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crystals-at-citycenter-las-vegas), a mall where no limit credit cards can be happily utilized. The most well known property through the thick of it all is the ARIA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas), if not one of the better casino hotels on the south Strip, if not among the most scintillating.The CityCenter, in spite of its initial problems, provides all visitors to the Strip luxurious options to spend their time in the City of Sin. It brings out a new dimension architecturally, a flashy range of eateries, venues, and entertainment, and will hopefully live up to all the hype it has built up for itself for the better part of the last decade.",8,dcqHjnmKPDdOseYEo6SdAw,6,54Ffdt_ucV3uCZWuWjDaXQ,10/26/2013,3,3,-5,3720 S Las Vegas Blvd,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 4, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}, 'BikeParking': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Shopping Centers', 'Shopping', 'Jewelry']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '10:00-23:00', 'Tuesday': '10:00-23:00', 'Friday': '10:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '10:00-23:00', 'Thursday': '10:00-23:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-23:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-0:00'}",1,36.10788944,-115.1744628,The Shops at Crystals,The Strip,89158,317,3.5,NV,Shopping,Nevada,Jando

Well, it only took us seven years to return to this genuinely open-air museum, this time with tickets in hand and happy to see that the 1961 lobby of the La Concha Motel was restored to become the visitors' center as planned (photo: http://bit.ly/2nmLQNm). Souvenir photos while you wait for the tour are purely optional (photo: http://bit.ly/2nRkETv)It's all quite organized with hour-long tours leaving every half-hour led by enthusiastic docents who go into the history of Vegas and the particulars of the more iconic signs on display. Strict rules abound with no backpacks allowed. Selfie sticks are also verboten, a rule I fervently applaud. Get that away from me. Because of the blazing sun, we were provided umbrellas and complimentary water bottles to allow us to survive the walk. The aged signs are arranged mostly to follow the historical timeline of Las Vegas starting with the signs for the Lido (photo:  http://bit.ly/2mg1hqG) and Binion's Horseshoe (photo: http://bit.ly/2n2Hc5R) built in the early 1950's. Granted much of what you see still looks like Fred Sanford's junkyard.At the same time, familiar landmarks like the Golden Nugget (photo: http://bit.ly/2n9UU7M) and the Tropicana (photo: http://bit.ly/2nmPgQ8) pop up as well as unique pieces for wedding chapels, Elvis (photo: http://bit.ly/2nn49la), and a gigantic skeletal skull (photo: http://bit.ly/2n2rZSC). The renowned hotel names show up at the end of the trail with the Frontier, the Dessert Inn, and especially the massive Stardust signs featured (photo: http://bit.ly/2mI74BG). Another part of the museum is located on the street median in the Fremont East area where refurbished neon signs are on display and lit up at night (photo: http://bit.ly/2nR7O7G).

It arrived with large scrapes and scratches on it. I emailed (with photo attached) to complain and was completely dismissed and  told "". This is a natural quality of the material and design in order to give it a ""vintage"" look - it will naturally wear in as the bag ages."" Let me tell you that was over 7 months ago and the scratches and scrapes are still as visible as the day it arrived and there is nothing natural looking about it. I was too annoyed to make an exchange as it took over a month just to get the purse in the first place. I will never order from them again.

My initial reason for shopping the brand was because they made vegan handbags and accessories. Then upon further research I found that these guys not only spare our furry friends, they also save the planet. Who wouldn't want to support a company doing so much?!!Their purses look like leather but they are 100% vegan and their lining is made of recycled material. I get compliments all the time and when I tell people it's not real leather they always want to touch my purse (I'm glad they're so interested but I'm not a fan of foreign hands on my goods). I typically shop directly from their site but a few boutiques around town carry their line. The website gives plenty of visuals and detail so I'm always happy with the actual product matching my expectations.Behind this fantastic brand is a great group of employees. I recently lost a tiny decorative screw to one of the purses I carry often. I emailed customer service, let them know what my issue was and I got a response the same day. They asked me to send them a couple of images for reference and then they sent out multiple options and a hand written note.Everything worked out perfectly and I appreciated their attention to detail. Since I've owned the purse for a couple of years now, I never would have thought they'd be so willing to help. But these guys really want you to be happy. And as a result, I just had to buy a couple more purses (but I digress).So I have no problem promoting a company that does so much for their customers and the planet.

I've been refilling my own inkjet and toner cartridges for decades. In the past 5 years it seams that the quality and consistency of 3rd party ink has gone from a joke to superior than OEM. It's also been difficult in the past to find a ink vendor that takes aim at a good price/quality balance. There are several older high end ink sellers who set their price point just below OEM ink, InkOwl costs less than 50% of OEM prices. I own several Epson wide format printers. I'm using InkOwl ink in an R800, R1800 and Pro 4000. So far the results are excellent on plain paper, a couple types of thick fine art paper and canvas. I've superficially measured color, their UltraChrome Hi-gloss shows a wider blue range than OEM and not quite as dense blacks. I haven't measured their UltraChrome K2 (it looks adequate). I'm happy enough to plan to start using InkOwl for all my refilling. I've purchased one set of (8) refillable cartridges, one had a bad chip and was replaced rapidly after one email. Their prices are competitive, their customer service is good and I'm very happy with the print quality.As a general note to those considering refillable cartridges vs a CISS... I recommend a 3rd option: Buy a printer that can use at least 50ml ink tanks (instead of the common 15ml or less) and get a couple sets of refillables.Oh ya and like the guys before me said refilling can be messy.

They were very accommodating and the trial was very inexpensive.  $22 for two weeks.  This is a fairly large facility, with two pools, a full size gym for basketball, etc..  a small aerobics studio, and a cardio equipment room with approximately 15 elliptical machines, 20 treadmills, 10 bikes (aside from bikes reserved for spin classes), a couple of rowing machines, a variety of Freemotion resistance machines, a free weight area, etc.   There is also plenty of parking and a day care center.   The cardio and resistance machines are mostly new and state of the art and they all face a row of several tv's that are mounted in the middle of the room.  Each is tuned to a major station, (CNN, ESPN, ABC, etc)  has closed captioning, and there is a place to plug your headphones in on each machine - though I did not see if it actually worked.I do wish they would ban the use of cell phones during your workout.  We do this at many, many gyms in the Silicon Valley and it really cuts down on the annoyance factor.   I'm here to get away from business and other issues and have some ""me time"" in order to clear my head and to focus on my health.  You, Jabberjaws, should be doing the same.Other than that, there is a 60 min time limit on machines, and disinfectant spray with paper towels to clean the machines after use.    Great.  Though washable hand towels may be more ecologically sound. I chose this gym because of the abundance of classes, including the ones I take at my gym at home - which are Zumba and the Les Mills classes (Bodypump, Bodycombat, etc).    They also offer Yoga, Pilates, Spinning and a variety of other classes.I took the Bodypump class and it was fine in that you know what to expect because Les Mills classes are a franchise type deal - so the choreography is always the same.  However, I was disappointed that the class was held in the Gym.   Due to the high gym ceilings it was very echo-y and difficult to hear the instructor and the music.  In addition, half of the gym was curtained off and people were playing basketball on the other side.  The noise was very distracting on top of the poor acoustics and made it even more difficult to hear.   The equipment was also pretty run down - but useable.   I understand that the facility is run by the city so one thing at a time, I suppose.The instructor was good but not great.  I have *alot* of experience with fitness classes and am a professional dancer.   I can safely say that her counts and cues were slightly off... particularly compared to other instructors I have experience with.  But , she was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. I also took the Tuesday night Zumba class and the instructor was a substitute during Xmas.   She was good but not great.  She did not follow through on movements (ie: no extension in her arms and her steps were shortened) and her rhythm was slightly off.   But she was very nice and encouraging and she knew her routines well.  I have been taking Zumba for over two years now, with several different instructors back home, and I am used to mostly VERY difficult workouts. This was not particularly hard for me, but YMMV.   If you are experienced at all with Zumba or other aerobics classes, you'll likely know how make it harder on yourself, if needed.  I never did make it to the BodyCombat class, so I can't say how that compares but I would encourage anyone to try it.  It's generally an easy to follow cardio-kickboxing class that can be modified for all levels.  When I return next year for the holidays I will likely join this gym again.   Overall, it was helpful to keep me on track with the battle of the Xmas bulge.",4,cfdC4yF9Kufk88Al0TNiTg,1,AGc9FADari4jsMxl9oU-fw,12/22/2009,3,4,29,11725 Verhoeff Dr,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'BikeParking': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Sporting Goods', 'Active Life', 'Shopping', 'Sports Wear', 'Gyms', 'Swimming Pools', 'Fashion', 'Fitness & Instruction']",Huntersville,"{'Monday': '5:00-21:30', 'Tuesday': '5:00-21:30', 'Friday': '5:00-20:00', 'Wednesday': '5:00-21:30', 'Thursday': '5:00-21:30', 'Sunday': '10:00-17:00', 'Saturday': '7:00-17:00'}",1,35.392098,-80.8449569,Huntersville Family Fitness & Aquatics,,28078,18,3,NC,Shopping,North Carolina,Shanna

It was about a 15 minute drive from the hotel after the evening rush hour - so no problem getting there.This Best Buy has a fairly well stocked Apple section - I double checked to make sure I had the right version of the power adapter (MagSafe 2), purchased it and was on my way!Thank goodness there was a Best Buy so close to the hotel!",0,uv-e-d43NN-1_DcCoJL-Og,0,iOalRGShgYry6IIrEqRM1A,3/27/2016,4,0,10,7400 Brookpark Rd,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'BikeParking': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['IT Services & Computer Repair', 'Car Stereo Installation', 'Local Services', 'Shopping', 'Computers', 'Automotive']",Cleveland,"{'Monday': '10:00-21:00', 'Tuesday': '10:00-21:00', 'Friday': '10:00-21:00', 'Wednesday': '10:00-21:00', 'Thursday': '10:00-21:00', 'Sunday': '11:00-20:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-21:00'}",1,41.41720205,-81.73373292,Best Buy,,44129,29,2.5,OH,Shopping,Ohio,Neal

Turns out my wool topcoat doesn't really cut it in these frigid temperatures and, with the almanac calling for one of the coldest Winters on record, it was about time I invest in an amazingly stylish, comfortable, and WARM winter jacket.  Since I exhausted nearly every option in Chicago I thought I would give my search a whirl at home.  A quick Yelp search led me to Appalachian Outfitters......which I have passed by hundreds of times.  I went to high school down the road and my former-athlete self used to frequent Virginia Kendall on a regular basis.  Who knew this place was such a treasure?I was impressed with how busy the place was on a Saturday but given that it was sandwiched between Black Friday and Cyber Monday it seemed there were many looking to score some great deals.  I found my way over to the Men's section (which loops around the left side of the building from the entrance) to see what I could find.  There are your more well-known names: North Face, Patagonia, Mountain Hardwear, etc. along with several lesser-known (read: smaller operations and foreign) brands.  I wanted something to mix up my excessive amount of North Face and Mountain Hardwear jackets in my closet and was excited to see that they carry the Jack Wolfskin line.  When I was in Germany a couple years ago I noticed EVERYONE was wearing this brand and, although I am not fashion forward, I thought it strange I had never heard of it.  I really liked the style but had not seen it anywhere else until I stopped in this store.  Since most of the jackets are locked with cables I had to wait a few minutes before an associate came by to try it on.  Soon Andrea, one of the associates, stopped by and we spent a bit of time talking about the brand, other stock they carry, the weather, and a bunch of other things.  Admittedly I tend to avoid store associates like the plague but this was a time that I really needed some help, and Andrea was there to help out.  Even the SO ended up walking out with an impulse buy.  If only she were to have gotten a commission on the sales!  This store has a wide selection of items for all your outdoorsy activities.  Even before the Black Friday discount I thought the prices were completely fair and was happy that they have a rewards program (which calculated to approximately 2%) for repeat shoppers.  The added bonus was that I was able to support a local business.  Win-win for all!Though distance will prevent me from making this a more regular go-to for my outdoors needs I will definitely be recommending it to friends and family in the area.

On a brief visit to Pittsburgh, this was one of top items on our very limited 'To-Do' list. We opted to skip the Warhol Museum and 'go to the Mattresses' because it seemed a bit more dynamic and also, I'll be honest, cheaper. Now, I'm not an art fanatic by any means. I look at it, I see things, I don't feel any emotional attachment, nothing's stirred, nothing moves me. I'm just dead inside. It's just a thing I'm looking at, that means zilch to me, though I'd be more than happy to assign anything 'art' a number from 1-10 to accurately show how boring or not boring I find it. Ignorant? Yes. Most definitely. But it's honest and I'd like to think there's a bit of honor in coming clean over bullshitting through some phony explanation of why something I really don't care for is or isn't poignant, and with that being said I liked the Mattress Factory because it didn't feel like a stuffy art museum. It was fun, you could move about almost freely, no guards, just guides and at points you're even encouraged to explore and touch. What I liked about the Mattress factory was that it had a sense of humor. It wasn't all serious all the time as we quickly discovered upon entering the 'Breast in the Press' installation, consisting of a dark room with an absolutely enormous statue of a topless woman with comically huge breasts and a music video being projected in onto each boob to the tune of 'My Humps' by the Black-Eyed Peas, but with the words changed and the large-breasted creator of the work singing topless while smashing her inked up breasts against sheets of paper at a desk, as if she was writing the news with her fun bags. This was an exhibit we saw back in November/December, and still, if I hear any clip of 'My Humps', I can't help but think of the Mattress Factory titty song. Another exhibit we walked into and 'accidentally' crushed part of. I use mini-quotes for the word 'accidentally' because at first I really did step on one of the ping pong balls littering the rectangular room on accident, but then when it popped and no one from the museum came out to yell at me I took it as free reign to do it again... and again, and again, and again and then eventually I just started picking them up started throwing them at my friends- triple words score if you hit in the testiculars! Anyway, I don't know what the artist wanted me to get from the exhibit, but I just assumed it was a test in seeing how long it took a regular museum-goer to turn delinquent and start wrecking sh*t. The exhibits using light were really cool. All optical illusion-y and the one pitch black room where you're only supposed to go two-at-a-time was great for scaring friends. We had a truce to not creep up or bad touch anyone in the exhibit, but of course we all failed to withhold our end of the treaty and it went from a silent 2-person exhibit to a screeching, poking, fondling, scary exhibit. Again, I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it, but somehow we all ended up interpreting it as the another 'break the rules' room. The doll room was creepy, but cool. As a hoarder, I appreciated being able to show my friends one place that might be scarier than mess-menagerie at my own place. Now maybe I'll invite them over. The room with the water was fun to jump from stone to stone and throw rocks and the sound thing hanging from the ceiling was neat if you were lucky enough to be by while someone walked over it from the floor above, but they should really make the 'Do not touch' sign bigger if they really don't want you to touch it, because I did not see that sh*t till my hands already gave it a good touch.The mirror room was the best part next to boobs. It's kind of silly, but it felt more interactive because you have to either take your shoes off or put mesh booties on to enter. It basically a bunch of colors and dots and mirrors and a few mannequins, but you can see yourself from all angles and somehow it was more fun than a standard dressing room, though it was basically the same, but with more decoration. Our group probably would've stayed here all day if there wasn't another group waiting to go in. There's more to the museum than just the one building, if you leave there's an outdoor area that was awesome because I saw a lizard go down the well thing and then I tried to catch it but I almost fell in the mud and my friends were ready to move on and climb other stuff, then if you go down the back alley/parking lot, around the corner and down up the road, you just flash your badge/ticket stub and you can see their other exhibit made up of odd housing installations. It wasn't reveting, but I liked the little hidden words and phrases found throughout the house. It felt like getting the fortune slip out of a fortune cookie, but without having to eat it.

No hybrid here, the hair's just gone.Me: I see.  **These are actual conversations from my tour of Trundle last Saturday, and one of the best tourist destinations I've ever had the good fortune to see**First off, I can't believe I get to be the first to review the infamous Trundle Manor. What.An.Honor. But I do have one question: How the hell has Trundle flown under the Yelp radar for so damn long? Step up your game, Pittsburgh! Don't let these gems pass you by. All my life I've been told that I'm strange, and in that life I've been to a lot of strange places, but this one is up there--even for me. Defo top 5, maybe even top 2 and absolutely a place a you should put on your bucket list, no matter who you are. Sure, dead sh*t in jars, hobo treasures and the singing steam-punk stomach tumor of a beloved belly dancer might not sound like everyone's idea of a good time, but try to keep an open mind and know that one trip to Trundle Manor will not only act as the centerpiece of your Pittsburgh memories, but as a major talking piece for the rest of your life. Promise. The only issue will be trying to find any place that can live up to the wonderment and awe of Pittsburgh's TM. The Curators of Trundle Manor's curiosities are the aforementioned Mr Arm and his lovely lady-friend/fiancee, Velda Von Minx. There's also a live cat amongst all the collected, stuffed and jarred felines named Little Devil who's just the biggest sweetheart. Their story is pretty cute and while I don't want to ruin it for you, it involves two taxidermied married squirrels that are on display in the den. Touring the manor is by appointment only, but there are times of the year where they don't do tours at all because the demand is just too high, namely in October when Halloween requests run rampant. If you're lucky enough to get an appointment to tour the manor, you should note that there is no official cost, though donations are accepted (and encouraged... by me). Keep Trundle truckin'! They'll accept cash in the donation box in the foyer or donation of dead animals, medical devices, cleavers, alcohol (no beer) or anything creepy, just don't be cheap--There's lots of eyes watching you at the manor. Among the many oddities already mentioned, you can also spy a number of the items below and then some. - Papa, Momma and Baby Bear + GoldiFox- An old-timey medical syringe that's large enough to act as a cattle prod- A cat on a hat- Legos- Colon photos- 100+ year old stuffed fox- Old electro-shock machine- Jar of human teeth- Jar of human skin flakes- Jar of human finger and toe nails- Tentacles- A family of amphibians- A happy turtle/chick hybrid family of five- Steampunk bears- Bindle stick bundles- A gerbil named 'poop'- Ray guns- Gimp-type masks- Original Addams family goodies- Carnival treasures- Classically un-classic built-up cars, fit for the zombie apocalypse- I got lucky and found a rogue bird foot on the floor during my tour, so keep your eyes peeled for hidden treats- And soooo much more...When you go (and you NEED to go) be sure to take pics, bring a decent donation and do ask as many questions as can. Half the fun is getting to hear the story behind each of the items from Velda and Mr Arm. If curious, peculiar, macabre are your thing, or even if you were ever a fan of the hit Nickelodeon show Cat-Dog, this is THE place to hit up if you're interesting in seeing a collection of quirk that you won't see anywhere else in the entire world.",29,WDoZyq_P1_R_9wepURjTWg,28,XzG9VrMZqppKPevASqooLg,12/5/2012,5,27,34,7724 Juniata St,"{'DogsAllowed': False, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': False, 'BikeParking': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': False}","['Art Galleries', 'Museums', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Venues & Event Spaces', 'Local Flavor', 'Shopping', 'Arts & Entertainment']",Swissvale,"{'Monday': '19:00-21:00', 'Friday': '19:00-20:00', 'Wednesday': '19:00-21:00', 'Thursday': '19:00-21:00', 'Sunday': '13:00-21:00', 'Saturday': '13:00-21:00'}",1,40.4227496,-79.8806393,Trundle Manor,,15218,11,4.5,PA,Shopping,Pennsylvania,Candice

But when I hear there's a market that has hand-made this & that and beer aaand outdoor grilling... well, now you've piqued my interest. Right off the bat I liked this event because I got a free full-size Fuze beverage thing before I even walked in the door. I'd never tried Fuze before and I'm also very poor so the idea of being able to get something tasty for $0 was, as you can imagine, a pretty big draw for a hoodrat like me. moving on...On a late Saturday afternoon the market was reasonably packed, but not as bad as some the hand-made markets with beer that I've attended back home. I like that the vendors were set up a bit segregated so anything with or for kids was kind of off to the side since kids are infamous for gumming up the works at crowded fests. The separation helped me avoid any situations where I might have to explain myself after ""accidentally"" kicking some child who's not yet mentally capable of recognizing the unspoken but agreed upon social flow of the marketplace, and over all kept the babies and their P's out of my impatient hair though there was at least one mother(f*cker) who thought the busy and crowded market was the perfect place to teach her 10-month old how to walk, and for that I mentally sentenced her to death by antique steam-punk firing squad... which conveniently there was a booth for. There were a few really neat vendors but because it seemed like most or all were to limited to their area of one standard-size folding table and the space behind it. I don't think shops were able to display too many items and I'm going to assuming that because of the table-size limitation. Vendors had to pick and choose a limited variety of stock to bring/display and that caused a lot of the vendors inventory to look really mis-matched and random. As an example, it seemed pretty par for the course to see one single vendor selling art prints of movie stills, knit owl barrettes and steam-punk business card holders, and while I'm sure there's a market for all of those things, there was a disconnection in the goods that translated to making the table look less desirable.On the other hand, because vendors had just a single table space and not an area where they could create a store cubby type nook with multiple tables and curtains, there was no getting grid-locked into a booth and not being able to get in or out or even see the goods. You were able to walk straight through the three main aisles and pretty clearly see what kind of stuff each vendor offered without having to squish in and fight for a spot to view the table, which was really nice and saved a lot of time, though it did mean that each shopper spent less time looking at a vendor's goods than the cubby/nook mock storefront way where you sort of get sucked in and trapped in into looking more and buying more. My favorite booths were the craft beer candles that smelled fantastic and were in old glass beer bottle that had been sawed in half and smoothed over as well as the super crowded jewelry vendor in the very back. I ended up getting (or being gifted by a very special someone) this bullet necklace I'd been eyeing. This market was great because while the shopping was all indoor, there was a beer tent outside, a hula hoop station (also a vendor) and multiple local restaurants had brought their goods and set up shop to grill on the plaza outside the market. And while everything smelled like delicious, smoky heaven, the lines were wrapping around the nearby businesses so we opted to wait it out and grab food elsewhere. I would definitely recommend I made it market to anyone with an urge to shop local and an hour or so to kill. It's not a destination or all day type thing, but it's a great mix of quality craft and the community, as well as being far from any super boring Holly Hobby church craft fair type thing. Check it out when it's in town. It's totally free to attend and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends, fam, kids or just yourself.",15,6N0AKJN3iEBRRituyVc-LQ,10,HUTz4sgTtOT-doB1VL7VRQ,12/7/2012,4,11,32,623 Smithfield St,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BikeParking': True}","['Shopping', 'Pop-up Shops']",Pittsburgh,{},1,40.4419281,-79.99793,I Made It Market,Downtown,15222,8,4.5,PA,Shopping,Pennsylvania,Candice

I give it three stars for a serious ""hit-or-miss"", and one extra star for plenty of parking and just because I love flea markets and outdoor markets. There's also two produce sellers inside who have great prices for avocados. I love me some avocado, especially at 85 cents a pop! I've picked up a week's worth of veggies for under $10.The parking can be a pain unless you navigate the outskirts of the lot. There is really nothing more annoying than gridlock due to 2 or 3 people who can't figure out what the f* they're doing. I realize we're in the ""laid back South"", but some of us don't want to spend our lives idling our cars and holding our breath until we get to move a few inches forward only to stop again. I've found decent stuff about 50% of the time I come here. It's a good place to find quirky gifts (Beatrix Potter dishware for that random Peter Rabbit fan.. did I just date myself?), or if you need some bakeware. Seriously I found a 9x12 Pyrex for $6. That'd be, what, $20+ at Target? It's not a screaming deal, but you'd have better luck here than at a thrift shop.. and it smells a lot nicer. About 65% of the booths are nonsense: old Avon products and cheap shoes or junk food. Gross. At least 20% of the booths are cell phone cases and accessories. The cases seem pretty cheap and not in the good way, but the cords are legit. Most of them will carry the original manufacturer charging cables for pretty cheap. I've seen some seriously nice stuff here, like a stone chess set that was just gorgeous. The guy said it was $40, which of course in flea market world really means somewhere between $33-38, or something (I'm not very good at the haggling). I've seen beautiful African carvings, seasonal items (Christmas dishtowels for $2, anyone?), even some pretty decent bookshelves. I would recommend several things:- Right around 9:45-10am seems to be the magic time during the colder months. I think it was more 9:15am during the summer. - Skirt the parking lot or pull up right to the building-doorways. It's like people are afraid to go all the way in (just the tip?!?), so I've always found spots here.- Bring cash to make your life easier, but do the small bills. It helps if you're haggling not to whip out the $20 bill. At least it helps me feel like less of a d*ck.- Get some tamales at Rico's Tamales. It's in the 2nd building in towards the center where the restrooms are. Trust me on this. They're $2 each and they are easily some of the most delicious tamales I've had outside of Mexico and Southwestern America. It's out of a truck and there's a fancy hand printed and lopsided sign. Whatever. Books and covers, you know? They're DELICIOUS.",7,m2ZvlibFIXL7FfH2lffOKw,2,LvIqRzyj-9vbk-E8reD0Bw,1/3/2015,4,4,42,3674 Hwy 51 N,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': False, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'BikeParking': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Thrift Stores', 'Flea Markets', 'Shopping']",Fort Mill,"{'Sunday': '8:00-16:30', 'Saturday': '7:00-16:30'}",1,35.089419,-80.920421,Barnyard Flea Market,,29715,29,3,SC,Shopping,South Carolina,Melissa

I thought it was going to be very busy on the first day but it was not. The store is the size of a small Harris Teeter or Bi-lo, and carries the same essential products. In addition to food, they sell cleaning supplies, pet supplies, and medicine (the store has a pharmacy like most stores this size). They do not sell TVs, toys, clothes, etc. Like all Walmart owned entities, they accept the chip payment cards which is a huge plus. They are also open 24/7 which makes it the only store on the east end of Fort Mill that is.The store seems a little dismal on the inside because of the grey used in it despite the bright green used on the outside of the store. Some things seem to be out of place. Prepared, packaged chicken is not near the fresh chicken and it took me a while to find it. The selection is limited. For example, they carry Stouffer's frozen entrees. Despite the store being the same size as the other grocery stores in the area, they only carry a few options of those. I bought a half gallon of store-brand organic milk which was only slightly cheaper than Bi-lo or HT. I also bought a dozen store-brand cage free eggs that were about a dollar cheaper than the name brands. I checked the eggs and ensured that none were broke. When I took one out to prepare, it was broken on the bottom. It was not a fresh break; it had been broken long before. I removed the few eggs from the tat side and cooked the rest. They did not taste that good.The parking lot is small, easy, and efficient. It can be accessed from 160 or N. Doby's Bridge Rd.

They had $10 off $50 coupons in the paper for the first week they reopened so I went to check it out. I shop here at the Indian Land one and a couple of other Aldi stores often. While most of the prices are low, there are  some things I do not like about this store. It looked great the second day after they reopened. Now, it is already messy. The coolers with the milk were leaking something onto the floor and making a mess. A lot of the products in the frozen coolers had fallen to the bottom on the floor of the cooler. The area by the carts is already a mess. The aisles are still cramped so when it is busy, it gets a little uncomfortable.For some reason, the shredded cheese is not with the other cheese - odd. If you want just one onion, potato, or pepper, you're not going to get it here. I would not use 5 pounds of potatoes so even at the $2.49 price I do not buy them. Prices also went up on some things after the renovation. All natural chicken and similar meat is the same price as it is other grocers. A half gallon of organic milk was $2.49; now it's $2.99.  By comparison, Organic milk is $6 a gallon at Harris Teeter. However, prices are good on many organic items. They did  not have conventional grapes though so the only option was expensive organic grapes, and that is not why people come to Aldi. You can definitely see traces of their sister chain, Trader Joe's, as Aldi begins to carry more organic items. Many of the products are the same with a different label.Many of the prices are still cheap though. Organic cage free eggs are $3.49 a dozen; regular eggs are less than a dollar. Things you typically see at Trader Joe's are priced similar here, such as spices, organic olive or coconut oil, cereal, breakfast bars, and some meats. They even have the $3 buck chuck sold under a different label - Winking Owl - and it's the same price. Organic and conventional salads are also very cheap. Aldi's also does not carry products with MSG, synthetic colors, and a few other potentially ""bad"" ingredients.The employees are usually nice and they did give me three more $10 off of $50 coupons for the following weeks. At Aldi, you can really stock up on a lot of stuff for $50, so that is a deal.

I ended making a purchase at that time then began receiving their mail order catalogs in my mailbox regularly.  After about a year of receiving these mailings I finally decided to place another order through their website.Duluth Trading features a line of exclusive work clothes made exclusively of their fire hose material.  I was kind of skeptical at first having read their description of how comfortable and durable these products were, but having regularly worn their fire hose work pants I can honestly say that these are definitely the toughest, most durable pants I've ever worn.  They're darn comfortable too.  The fabric repels water and any stain that has ever collected on them washes out easily in the laundry.One of my side jobs consists of setting up road race courses on city streets throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.  While on the job I usually sit on the tail of a pick up truck or a flat bed truck and drop or pick up orange traffic safety cones, delineators and/or road closure signage.  Often I find myself having to jump on and off moving vehicles as the job requires.  As you can imagine my jeans need to be pretty durable, and I've certainly ripped more than my share of jeans or cargo pants by doing that, but I've yet to experience any rippage in any of my fire hose work pants.  Two summers ago I flew off the back of a cargo van while on the job.  The knee area on the portion of my Levi's jeans completely disintegrated as I tore a chunk off of my knee.  Yes, it was as painful as I described it, but I truly think thicker jeans might have reduced the severity of the injury.  Coincidentally, I flew off the back of a pick up truck earlier this year when my driver took off before I had properly secured myself.  The impact felt the same, but the incident didn't leave a single blemish on my fire hose pants, and with the exception of a ripped jacket sleeve I was able to continue working.  Right after that event I went online to purchase several more pairs of the toughest pants I've ever used.  Each pair of pants has eleven pockets also which means I don't have to hang separate sheaths on my belt for my leatherman, my buck knife, my wire cutters, my pliers, my cell phone and my walkie talkie.  There are more than enough pockets for all of those tools.Lately I've been purchasing lots of their DTPro line of work gloves too.  These are very similar to the Ironclad brand of work gloves that I used to purchase with extra lining on the palms and the fingertips, a good snug fit with velcro closures that wrap tight around the wrists.  I like that second skin feeling I got with those gloves.  Duluth's line of work gloves are very similar, but they cost a lot less and when I buy three or more I can enjoy an even more substantial discount.  I just purchased a pair of Duluth's waterproof work gloves that still cost less than the non-waterproof Ironclads found at my local hardware store.  I'm looking forward to no more cold, wet hands while on the job.I love Duluth Trading Company.  Check them out on the internet.  In addition to their tough and comfortable work clothes they carry regular apparel and accessories for men and women, unique tools and gifts and old-fashioned toys.  Their funniest product is probably their Anti Monkey Butt Powder.  I'll let you find out what that is on your own.",25,77FUdM-bbaiQ4AaJ7hsdeA,9,bOqQze9nxfwHY4zDJ6FrEA,12/22/2008,5,8,14,170 Countryside Dr,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BikeParking': False}","['Shopping', 'Accessories', ""Women's Clothing"", 'Personal Shopping', ""Men's Clothing"", 'Fashion']",Belleville,{},1,42.8631165,-89.5267022,Duluth Trading Co,,53508,74,3,WI,Shopping,Wisconsin,Wilhelm

Thus it was, on a trip to Madison, that I cleverly took my jewelin' pal into Tropic Jewel for a quick supply run, while secretly planning to turn her into my own personal one-woman sweatshop.First I must tell you that Tropic Jewel is flippin' hot in summertime.  It's on the second story of this weird strip mall, so you not only have to haul yourself up a flight of stairs, but once you get up there, there's no A/C waiting for you.  Pause and catch your breath before heading in, because it gets stuffy in there when it's crowded.If you have any interest in jewelry-making at all, though, is this ever the place for you.  Shelves and shelves of bead trays, sorted by color, contain every kind of bead you could imagine and then some.  One whole table is devoted to pearls, natural and dyed.  In addition to smaller beads, they have large semi-precious stone pendants and even some metal pendants.  There's also a good selection of findings, tools, and kits.  I especially liked the beginners' kits, which had everything you needed to make, say, a pair of chandelier earrings or a bracelet.  Lots of times those beginners' kits are pretty lame, but these projects were actually cool things that you'd want to wear - or give as gifts.We picked out some nice coin pearls, glass beads, and other beads for me, and with my friend's help, I ended up getting three pairs of earrings for less than what one pair would have cost in a department store.  But even if you're not a jewelry expert, the staff is helpful and will answer your questions, and I believe they even hold classes there to teach beginners how to use their new purchases.If you can take the heat (it's not called Tropic Jewel for nothing), this is a nice place to browse, plan projects, or pick up a piece of finished jewelry for yourself or someone else.  It was almost enough to make me want to take up beading myself - like I need another time-sucking hobby in my life.",4,erilrfq0TCOU5fHUqITyYA,2,Urz44DVjS6-1fSyPlClQOw,7/22/2006,4,5,24,"449 State St, Ste F","{'DogsAllowed': False, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'BikeParking': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Jewelry', 'Arts & Crafts', 'Shopping']",Madison,"{'Monday': '11:00-18:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-18:00', 'Friday': '11:00-18:30', 'Wednesday': '11:00-18:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-18:00', 'Sunday': '12:00-17:00', 'Saturday': '11:00-18:30'}",1,43.074475,-89.393396,Tropic Jewel,Capitol,53703,9,4,WI,Shopping,Wisconsin,Stephanie

Unfortunately, when I went to do some research on local cooking classes, most of them were way out of our budget.  That is, until I spoke to Marti at Sweet Basil.  Marti was extremely accommodating and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the pricing for our group was reasonable compared to some of the other cooking schools that I was looking into.  There was a great selection of menus to choose from as well.  I went with the ""Easy Entertaining"" option, which included recipes for the following items:* Baked Brie with Shallots & Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce* Smoked Salmon Cakes with Lemon Dill Aioli* Grilled chicken Satay with Ginger Mustard Sauce* Bloody Mary Shrimp* Pork Pot Stickers with Garlic Soy* Pepper-Crusted Steak with Horseradish cream* Mini Caramel Pecan Pies with Bourbon whipped CreamWhen the group arrived, there were aprons for all, and Marti introduced herself and Chef Linda prior to us beginning.  Our group was ready to get our hands dirty right away, but we did have to be patient as Chef Linda walked us through each recipe... From there, we buddied up (except for Emi H who bravely took on the Chicken Satay on her own) and were on our own with the large kitchen and ingredients.  Tiffany and I did the Brie which was by far the easiest, but we had fun with it and it turned out incredibly (if I can say so myself)!All in all, this was a fabulous evening, and great for team building too... but if you do book Sweet Basil, a couple of things to keep in mind that may be helpful:*While SB does provide iced tea and water, they allow BYOB, so if your group is anything like mine, I do recommend taking advantage and bringing some wine!*You'll likely begin your class promptly at 6:30, but won't be digging into the food for quite some time, so you may want to grab a bite prior to arriving or ask about purchasing some snacks to nosh on while you eat.In addition to the above, note that SB is also a fabulous store for all kinds of cookware, kitchen accessories, and more...

Do not order the Seafood Pistou.  Larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, I ordered it anyways.  It was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  The seafood didn't taste so fresh and I think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  However, Kristin C. chose right - she had the Ahi Tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to Kristin, it was fantastic!  Note to self:  order Ahi if I ever return!  Oh, and I tasted the Asian Pear Salad too - it was tasty.  So, the 2.5 star rating is an average... COMPANY - 5 stars!I'm going to allow the fact that I had a really fun dining companion bring up the average a bit here...BANG FOR YOUR BUCK- 2 starsWe had only water and perrier to drink and our bill was still kind of high for what I thought was just an ok meal... essentially 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 Perrier was over $80 out the door!I admit that this review is based on just one experience... however, because of the fact that I have no clue when I'll go back, I wanted to review it anyways!  If you go to HOT, go for the ambiance and order the tuna! :)",10,SurnOSM2bVVN4-Js3G23RQ,8,2LrSCn-j_TzofxrEt-50gQ,1/13/2008,4,1,21,114 E 7th St,"{'Alcohol': 'full_bar', 'HasTV': False, 'NoiseLevel': 'average', 'RestaurantsAttire': 'casual', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'Music': {'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'karaoke': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'jukebox': False}, 'Ambience': {'romantic': True, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}, 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': True, 'BYOBCorkage': 'no', 'Caters': False, 'WiFi': 'free', 'RestaurantsReservations': True, 'BikeParking': True, 'RestaurantsTakeOut': True, 'GoodForKids': False, 'HappyHour': True, 'GoodForDancing': False, 'Open24Hours': False, 'RestaurantsTableService': True, 'OutdoorSeating': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'RestaurantsDelivery': False, 'BestNights': {'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}, 'GoodForMeal': {'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'breakfast': False, 'brunch': False}, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'CoatCheck': False, 'Smoking': 'no', 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Bars', 'Home Services', 'Nightlife', 'French', 'Restaurants', 'Wine Bars', 'Real Estate', 'American (New)']",Tempe,"{'Monday': '11:00-22:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-22:00', 'Friday': '11:00-22:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-22:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-22:00', 'Saturday': '11:00-22:00'}",1,33.4235148,-111.9374375,House of Tricks,,85281,875,4,AZ,Home & Service,Arizona,Gabi

But now that I'm a ""grown-up"" I can honestly say that I can cook! It took major life changes and the possibility of starvation to do it, but through cookbooks and the internet, I can boldly say that I am able to cook anything as long as I've got a recipe! So when we went to the Sweet Basil cooking school for a work outing I was excited to put my cooking skills to the test.We started off with Linda our instructor giving us an overview of what we were cooking and she had us volunteer to break off into pairs. She asked for one person to go solo and I raised my hand. Our menu for the evening was ""Easy Entertaining"" and were a mix of sweet and savory dishes. I had the task of making grilled chicken satay skewers. It took about 90 minutes for everyone to finish cooking and we ate the dishes as they were completed. Each recipe was easy to prepare and there were a handful I'd choose to make at home for parties. My skewers needed to be grilled and that's a skill I've never honed so it was nice to do something new! Our instructor Linda was very nice and she reminded me of the days when I used to cook with my grandmother. She was very encouraging and made me feel really great about my dish! I think in my next life I will go to culinary school and become a chef! Not so I can open a restaurant per se, but simply because I enjoy creating dishes and making folks happy through food!Great team building exercise and a nice change from the regular sit down dinners. It's BYOB but I'd warn that you should probably eat something before hand because it'll be awhile before you get to eat your dinner!

Parking is in the back- be careful parking anywhere else, as your car might get towed.  There are misters for those who like eating outside.  Since I've only been here once, and I had to eat at the bar area for happy hour, I don't know what the noise level is indoors, but it certainly seems nice in there, if not a bit cramped.  A big minus for me is that smoking is allowed outside, so I'm hoping to secure a table indoors on my next visit.Ordered the only cocktail on the menu that uses ginger liqueur (sorry, but I forgot the name), and really liked it!  It tasted light and refreshing, but packed quite a punch, so be careful-- it went down very smoothly and very fast!  Happy hour knocked off only $1, down to $9, so I suppose it's good that the bartender had a heavy hand.  ;)  As for my entree, I had the Roasted poblano, artichoke, and spinach dip, which came w/ both crostini and water crackers.  Skip the water crackers (they felt stale when I bit into them, and they're very bland) and stick w/ the crispy, nicely-toasted, and olive oil-drizzled crostini.  I did, and I ate the entire thing!  (Well, minus the water crackers.)  The base was very creamy, yet also chunky (I love foods that layer on many textures!), and I really appreciated the heat that the roasted poblanos brought to this dish.  From the moment I took that first bite, I thought that  this dish was different from any other spinach and artichoke dips I've ever tried.  Try it if you're into s/a dips, and let me know what you think of this one!The rest of the menu sounds great, but can get very pricey (salads and soups, $6-10; starters, $10-19; and entrees, $20-32).

Finally had the chance to check this once-a-month feature SL holds every first Wednesday (where an established customer takes along someone who's never been to take advantage of the BOGO offering (buy one, get one).  I was told that this feature applies only towards spa services, but that I'd be able to take Mom in so that we'd both be able to get a shampoo/cut and color.Now, first I have to say that my first coloring (Feb.) didn't last very long- I noticed fading within the first two weeks!  I thought perhaps using another color-enhancing shampoo/conditioner set after one week of religious use of Aveda products may have been the culprit (perhaps chemicals in the second set caused color to fade), but after discussing it with Rachael, I decided I'd use more expensive color-safe products, shampoo less (I normally wash my hair twice a day on the days I work, and at least once-a-day on my days off), AND rinse with cold water after every shower to ensure that the hair cuticles properly close, but no... Mom and I BOTH noticed significant color fading WITHIN the FIRST week of the treatment.Other disappointments include Mom's complaint of uneven shearing of her hair; my slight disappointment in the way my hair ""moves"" with the new haircut; the very small pool area out back, and the lack of privacy we encountered compared to the other spas we've experienced while accessing the pool, sauna, and steam rooms, to name a few.  To add insult to injury, the receptionist decided to skip me and take care of the group of older women behind me when it came time to pay.  After a few minutes, when she was ready to direct her attention to me, the receptionist first tried to charge double for the services- basically negating the BOGO offer, but I reminded her that we were there for ""Live at Lamar,"" so she then tried to do a ""buy one, get 50% off the second"" deal, to which I again balked at.  I also added a couple of hair products to my bill, and after I had given her enough spafinder gift certificates to cover the salon services, the products, and Rachael's tip (20% of what TWO sets of cut and color would regularly cost), she tried to tell me that I still had a balance that needed to go on a credit card, citing that the tip could not be paid with the certificates!?!?  I asked how she arrived at this conclusion after I ran down the bill and the certificate amounts I'd given her, writing everything on paper.  She apologized and said she had not realized I'd already included Rachael's tip (!?!?).  Whatever great experiences I could've relayed to friends, relatives, coworkers, and clients about SL's ""Live at Lamar"" flew out the window within those closing minutes.  And then, not even a week later, Mom and I noticed the significant color loss...I'd hate to have to find another spa and hair stylist/colorist, since Rachael seems to be a genuinely friendly and sincere person, but if I can't come away feeling blissful and know I got great color/value for the money, how can I recommend this spa to others?  How can I go back and pay for haircolor that doesn't even last a week?  Mom still complains every now and then (and it's only been 19 days, for goodness' sake!), and our only consolation is that I can't take her back for another ""Live at Lamar"" experience since it's a feature only good for those clients' friends who've never been.  Hmm... kind of ironic, when you think about it...p.s.  Rachael, did you get your $48 tip, as well as commission from product sales?  BTW, the two-star review isn't a reflection on Rachael's abilities as a colorist, but the treatment Mom and I received from the receptionist, as well as the lack of color fastness of Redken coloring products.  A colorist can only do so much w/ the products on hand, yes?  A coworker told me Goldwell products work well.

Management was easy-going and friendly both times I've gone to retrieve the pool key (last year and this year, around the same time-frame).  However, the gate's lock is always a hassle to unlock.  Both times I've let management know that the key, or lock, needs to be replaced.  The pool is irregular in shape, so it's hard to get a decent exercise.  I finally opted to just swim the perimeter.  (The pool at the complex I live in is geometric, but there is a straight path that allows for sufficient laps.)  Miramonte's pool is very deep (about 8 feet) in most areas, so what it lacks in distance, it makes up in endurance-- I find it harder to swim with that much more water underneath.  On my first time swimming there last week (Wed), the water temperature was almost as hot as that of their jacuzzi!  It's a good thing I didn't have much time to swim, or I probably would've had a worse headache than I ended up with when I finally surfaced.  I didn't have time to stop at the office to file a complaint, but I did mention it the following morning to personnel at the complex I live in, and by Friday, the water temperature was back to normal temperatures, which is around 82 degrees F at my complex's pool.

I checked on Yelp and Gabi came to my rescue!

Duane informed me that while he was fully booked that day, he could see me the following day, which meant I'd have to call out of work.

Not only did Duane attend to all the repairs in 90 minutes the next afternoon, but included in that time, he also assisted in choosing a garbage disposal at a nearby Home Depot to replace the one that wouldn't work anymore, despite his assumption that it was nothing more than a stuck penny or broken glass- this has happened once before.  I should add that I had him look into a second toilet tank that a housemate had complained about.  Where a disreputable repairman could have taken this opportunity to charge me for unneeded repairs, Duane revealed to me his honest and trustworthy nature in telling me that the tank didn't need any repairs done!  He was also more than happy to show me how to do future repairs myself and also offered to walk me through them via phone in the future, should I elect to go that route!

We most likely will continue to be a tenant in San Francisco as our company enjoys the ease of transitioning into this kind of office and enjoys furnished office setup that Regus offers even though you're paying a premium price for those services.  And trust me, Regus will charge you for everything from the office phone (separate fees for the handset and actual phone line), internet access, black/color copies, scanning, mandatory kitchen fees, and garage parking (optional although fairly affordable here).  We initially locked into a year long lease and was at this Phoenix location for about two full years.  I didn't really have any major problems with this Phoenix location until I took over the management of our company's billing system.  When you initially sign the lease, you have to commit to how many phone handsets and internet lines you want.  You pay for these office features like it is an a la carte menu just like a restaurant.  What I was not thrilled about is that we eventually had to downsize our operations from 2 people to 1 person at this Phoenix location during our initial lease, and we were still forced to pay for two phone lines and two internet connections.  Keep in mind that the monthly total for a phone line and an internet connection amounts to about $200/month (and that does not include the long distance usage fee you incur on your phone) so it is a fairly expensive feature.  I figured that Regus would have been reasonable enough to help us out but it was stated in our original contract we are responsible for the fees so I guess they have a ""gotcha"" on that one.  But when we accidentally forget to cancel our lease, our lease got rolled over for another six months and we were still being charged internet/phone charges for two people when we obviously only have one person occupying the office!!!!  I feel Regus need to use some common sense and ensure that company's are only being charged for the amount of people that occupy the office; especially when it comes to an automatic renewal.  Sadly, this location does not act on the side of the tenants who occupy their facilities.  Talk about ensuring the client gets shafted.My second major gripe about this location is with center manager  Valinda Evans.  Since at the time our company in the US only had two employees and two offices, we felt it was more productive to have two people in the same Regus office (in San Francisco).  Therefore we decided to leave the Phoenix office unoccupied with three months left on our lease.  I understand that you have to abide to the terms of your lease but I referenced to Ms. Evans of our unique situation and it wasn't until three weeks later after my two e-mail inquiries that I received a response.  Three weeks is highly unacceptable when you have a situation where you are in a position to leave your Regus office unoccupied and notification is made to the center manager.    I would have liked a little bit of flexibility and perhaps be able to transfer our Regus financial obligation to our SF office or pay an early termination fee.  Anything reasonable would have been helpful but the only reasonable option I had was to ""take additional space and sign and new contract.""  She also added that ""there is really nothing that I can do unless you take additional space in another location.""   Wow, so not helpful.  I was not seeking to get out of our leasing obligation, just to find a way to make it a little more convenient so we do not let an office sit dormant for three months which was such a waste.  If you are considering this Regus space in downtown Phoenix, I would highly recommend seeking other office options.  Phoenix has plenty of real estate in downtown and it should not be too difficult to find a sufficient alternative.Tip: Regus will not notify you prior to the termination of your signed lease.

This latest ownership and management team seems to be dedicated to keeping the complex upgraded and making it inviting to new residents. Having lived here over 7 years (the magic number?) I have seen many changes & improvements - some good, some not so good. These new management & maintenance teams appears to be working diligently to provide updates and aesthetically pleasing improvements to the front of the complex. ""Good marketing."" New trees, new desert plants, new paint, new signage and especially a new flag. Currently the leasing office & fitness spaces, along with the main pool area are being upgraded. They are closed for ""a few months.""  One of the near-by apartments (N121) is serving as the temporary leasing office.Along with the flutter of activity to improve and upgrade the front of the complex, there are still some hiccups that have been concerns for some time. I was preparing to update this review last week to praise the ""new"" landscape maintenance team. In the past they have cut the hedges & plants down to just barely sticks. All foliage (leaves, blossoms) was stripped bare. 1) Last week I had noticed that, although the plants were not allowed to get large, they actually were green and, even the oleanders had a few pink blossoms on them. By the next morning I heard the electric edge cutters stripping the plants bare once again. Now we have a bunch of sticks once again. The beautiful Mexican Bird of Paradise near my apartment has been broken back and stripped back so poorly so many times that I think it is permanently traumatized. (It should be trimmed back carefully once a year.) The new beauty of the front of the complex is not reflected in the back areas where the residents live. 2) We still need some ""Go slow"" ""10mph"" or ""Drive slowly"" signs throughout the complex. Garbage trucks, water delivery trucks, UPS, Fed-Ex, moving vans, fast cars, motorcycles, etc. all race through the small narrow parking areas. Folks out walking their dogs and residents backing out of their garages & parking spaces are all taking their lives into jeopardy daily.  Since we each are paying an extra $5 per month, this would be a nice way to spend some of that $60 annual parking lot charge.3) Lighting. Some dark areas need to have much better lighting. new lights are smaller than the old ones. The new management seems to be trying to create community through periodic events. The latest one was a Pool Party on a Saturday. Great idea, but it was only announced a couple of days before the weekend . . . . . and the weekend was Mother's Day weekend. I am sure many residents who might have attended to get to know their neighbors and the new management team had already made plans for that weekend. I certainly had already made plans.Yes, i do recommend this complex, but there are some caveats that I want others to know before they move in. The Tempe location is great, but nothing is perfect. The upgrades to the many floor plans are making the complex an even nicer place to live. But, I'd like to see more of a community feel and more input from residents who pay thousands a year to live here.VILLA BLANCO:  Just remember that residents spread the word through word of mouth, social media and, yes, YELP.  Both good and bad. And long term residents are financially a much better deal then constant turn-over.",6,vU4LIjHpFqTQ-AonRAqblg,3,tvpeoP_h1E_8PQAA4hMxBw,5/20/2017,3,2,45,1820 E Bell De Mar Dr,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Apartments', 'Real Estate', 'Home Services']",Tempe,"{'Monday': '9:00-18:00', 'Tuesday': '9:00-18:00', 'Friday': '9:00-18:00', 'Wednesday': '9:00-18:00', 'Thursday': '9:00-18:00', 'Sunday': '12:00-17:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-17:00'}",1,33.3603954,-111.9099823,Villa Blanco,,85283,10,3,AZ,Home & Service,Arizona,Rachel

It is no longer ""Little Cottonwoods Apartments"" - effective on May 3rd, 2016. It was previously managed by ""MEB Management Services"". It is now to be managed by ""Avenue5 Residential"", a management company for properties in the Western United States. The complex name is changing to ""Villa Blanco"", also effective on 5/03/16. Lease payments are still going to Little Cottonwoods Apartments. Somewhat strange. You would have thought they would have gotten all their ducks-in-a-row before changing hands. This will be the 3rd management (ownership?) change since I have lived here. With the last change the entire complex was painted the new tri-color paint scheme that has been so popular the last couple of years in the southwest. And now we change the name to ""White Village""? Fingers crossed that we don't have to live through another massive paint fiasco. We'll see how this new company conducts itself. Do they want long-term satisfied residents, or are they willing to continue to have the large turnover and somewhat iffy reviews?

This was perfect for our late night binge on Pokey Stix.  *droool*  And, yes, the front desk closes at 11.  If you plan on arriving after that, you'll have to be 'buzzed in' by security (via a phone in the entranceway), so make sure that you have your reservation confirmed (or else they won't let you in!)  Shout-out to the front desk guy who totally hooked us up with a mini-funnel...and for not judging me when I asked for a mini-funnel.

This was my first time visiting a Habitat for Humanity store. I still have not bought anything from these stores before, but this place was super busy on the Saturday morning. The first floor has a small section for electronics, mainly old CRT TVs and other random electronics. They have many desk, tv stands, chairs at very good prices. Depending on your luck I can see how you can make off with a very good deal. The chairs themselves were very old and I could not see myself buying a used recliner. The basement has tons of hardware material well organized. On the second floor is home goods. Lots of the merchandise on this floor is very very old.

With moving in, I have unfortunately frequent this location quite a bit so let me highlight the ups and downs1. I had my blinds custom measured and installed by lowe's contractor. Friendly guy came out to measure and install with his wife. Only 99 dollars for 9 windows and 10 dollar more to do the patio. GOOD2. When I went to the store to have the custom blinds ordered. It took 20 minutes for someone to come to that department. BAD3. That certain someone was pissed off throwing things and slamming cabinets because I came too soon after the window measuring even though I explained to him I was leaving town and the manager said it was okay to come in with the picture of the measurements. BAD4. I had 2 sets of custom cut blinds that were available in store. Somehow the measurements were off on both of them 1/4 to 1/2 inch even though they were suppose to be cut the same VERY BAD5. When I came back in they realize that they had to cut new ones and replace them. I had no issues this time. GOOD6. I bought a washer/dryer. They don't do gas installation and you have to pay 100 dollars for someone to come out. This is not a big issue, but the guys that delivered it from lowe's did not carry it up the stairs instead they used a trolly and pulled it up dirtying the carpet. They also just left the washer sitting there and did not help with the installation. BAD7. I bought two storm doors online and they said it was in stock and ready for pickup. I arrived and they told me sorry we don't have them even though they were clearly in the back under a similar SKU number. They had messed up. OKPros: large selection, some employees are very helpfulCons: please read the above for all of the bad issuesHidden deals:1. They price match all local stores and give you 10% more savings2.

This apartment was both good and bad. The apartment itself was decent. True, it wasn't in that great of condition and some things really needed to be changed (the bathroom sink looked like someone took a sledgehammer to it and we also later discovered there was a bird's nest in the exhaust from our kitchen), but overall it was decent-especially for a first apartment. It was super cheap and that was what was important at that time. There was a lot of space in the apartment, but most of it was wasted on the hallway. The kitchen was so tiny I couldn't comfortably be in it at the same time as my boyfriend but had a TON of cabinets that were decently made and sturdy. A lot of things were pretty shoddily done though. For example, the cutout for the sliding doors of the closet in the main bedroom was not straight and correct and therefore, the closet doors never shut properly. I actually measured how far away the edge of the cutout was from the corner of the room and the number changed the farther up the wall it went. Obviously, someone didn't take the time to measure anything. The layout itself was interesting and not bad, but again- there was a lot of wasted space for the hallway. And the place was just generally kind of dirty and old. We lived on the first floor and right next to the entrance to the building. The area was not *that* great, so we did feel largely unsafe there. The parking lot where the dumpster is located is really badly lit and just generally scary and creepy. You just get some weird people by that area. And because it's right next to Centennial High School, you get stupid high-schoolers who hang out in the 3x5 foot area when you enter into the building who drink and smoke. (You also hear all the football games and marching band practices in case that bothers you. Personally, I kinda liked it since I went there myself). There was one time when I came home from a friend's house at night and there was some stoned dude sitting on the top of the stairs staring at me as I frantically tried to unlock the door to get inside my apartment. :o/We never had any problems with things not really working. The living room A/C would randomly stop and I had to get someone to help me with a light in the kitchen. And the pressure in the shower was way too much. It would spurt out so much water, that water would start to gather inside the tub around your feet because it couldn't drain fast enough. But otherwise, everything worked great! And thank god too, because I've read horror stories about maintenance.. What was horrible was the staff. I spoke with CPM representatives at all different locations in Champaign and they were all unprofessional and, frankly, not all that intelligent. I had issues with our previous manager more than once, before the new manager took over who seemed on the ball for the most part. Don't even bother paying for a parking spot, because someone will ALWAYS be in it. And when you call a tow truck to tow them away, they always leave before the tow truck gets there. Luckily, though, we could park alongside the complex on the street.Noise insulation was basically non-existent. We heard our neighbors upstairs constantly- especially when the new residents moved in who had about a billion kids who never seemed to go to school or anywhere. They had a party once where I swear they were jumping OFF a bed onto the ground right above our bedroom. It was midnight and whenever they would land, our light fixture would shake so violently, I thought it was going to fall down on us on the bed. I called the police twice, but I'm not sure if they ever showed up. Grounds upkeep was a joke. They came out and watered flowers and crap, but there was always trash all over the place, especially when the dumpster would overflow. The outside of the building was started to look dilapidated. When we moved out, we had to arrange and pay for the carpet to be cleaned and then give them evidence that we had cleaned it. They said that they needed time to be able to clean it as well, but what I've heard from others about conditions, I don't think they do anything. There was a big red sprayed stain that looked like dried blood on the ceiling in the master bedroom when we moved in. We could never get it out ourselves. Gross and highly disturbing. You'd think they would have painted over that if they actually did paint like they say they do. Also, trying to get our deposit back was a big frickin hassle. Me and my boyfriend moved to Austin, Texas so I couldn't go talk to them personally but had to basically harass/stalk them over the phone constantly. It took a few months before we finally got the check in the mail. Like I said, it was good for the price, but you get what you pay for. I would never move back in with them again.",4,phIxx-A5A0YYJbxQU3zpZA,0,z_ycHnt_y9tSI2S1D2oiYA,8/10/2010,1,2,1,702 Crescent Dr,{},"['Real Estate', 'Home Services', 'Apartments']",Champaign,{},1,40.109018,-88.2810032,Campus Property Management,,61821,3,1,IL,Home & Service,Illinois,Lauren

But it seemed right to focus on the Mass Transit District of Champaign-Urbana, the bus system that keeps my life in order.  I moved a month ago to Chambana, and it has quickly become apparent that I do not live in Southern California any more.  The land is flat, the wind comes sweeping through, the place is smaller in scope, and I'm rapidly realizing that I'm not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky.Enter Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.There's no need for a parking permit when there are countless, continuously running lines covering the entire area.  My weekday mornings find me checking my house, looking through my backpack, making sure all my stuff is in order, before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the 13 Silver South Line to campus, which runs twice an hour.  If I'm worried about catching the bus, the MTD has a text messaging service, where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving.  Let me tell you, a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts. :)The website is unfortunately abbreviated (http://www.cumtd.com), but wonderfully comprehensive.  I've had generally great luck with the drivers on the 5, 10, 13, and 7, and I'm really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible, constant, reliable mass transit.  I'm slightly less worried about gas prices, as it's free for university students to ride the ever-present CUMTD system. :)In short, thank you so much, Chambana MTD for getting me where I need to go all the time, every time.",13,ZfQY1dNPN8IYmwEjZuVtVg,11,qgJP5-eu5gDIBqJiNwl18Q,9/19/2008,5,7,15,1101 E University Ave,{},"['Movers', 'Home Services']",Urbana,{},1,40.115404,-88.195252,Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District,,61802,13,4,IL,Home & Service,Illinois,Teej

It was $50, which actually beat out the price at a Super 8 by $5.  Sold.I saw on the website that their front desk is only open until 11.  Since I would be arriving late, I called to ask about what would happen if I arrived after 11.  She said that there is a phone between two sets of doors where I could dial a certain number, and there would be a night attendant to check me in, but only if I had a guaranteed reservation.  So, that's good.I arrived around 10, so everything was fine in that regard.  The guy at the front desk was extremely polite.  I was also happy to see that he had long hair, pulled into a ponytail--not because it was pulled into a ponytail, but because management allows someone who's not 100% clean cut to work there.The hotel itself is dingy at best.  It's worn down and not clean looking at all.  The rooms are in much better shape, but they're definitely not the Ritz.  Each room has a very well-kept kitchenette, complete with a coffeemaker, some silverware, a dish drainer, and some plates and mugs.  There may have been a microwave.  The bathroom is similarly pleasant (I enjoyed a long soak in the deep tub).  Both areas have hardwood floors, which I thought was a nice touch.The rest of the room, however, left something to be desired.  It looked cheap in comparison.  The bedspread was shiny and maroon--you know what I'm talking about.  The bed itself was incredibly firm, but not dangerously uncomfortable.  The pillows were absolutely the worst part....they were soft like marshmallows, but not in a comfy way...more like, in an entirely unsupportive way.  The t.v. was small, there were few channels (except for Showtime) and the remote barely worked.  The walls were fairly thin, since I could hear people's coffeemaker's working at 6 a.m.  Also, they have a sheet saying that they only do refresh services every 7 days, more often if you pay for it--but they won't do the dishes.I know that, for $50, I should not really be complaining.  But ultimately, these 'suites' are supposed to be aimed at people who will be staying there for weeks or months at a time.

I had locked my keys in my car one evening and was having trouble getting them out myself.  I  called Highland Wrecker and they told me it would be about an hour, they took my name and phone number.  While waiting I continued to try to get my car unlocked and low and behold I did. I called immediately and was unable to reach the locksmith. Then I called the office and told them I didn't need the locksmith any more, they didn't know what to do and said I needed to talk to the person who was coming. While i was still on the phone with the office,  I received ac all from the lock smith who was nearing my location.  I told him I had just gotten the car open and asked what needed to be done, assuming I would at least pay for gas ~15 miles each way, and a half hour of their time.  He didn't know and said he needed to call his boss, at the office...  I told him to just call me back when he knew what to do.  I didn't receive a call for about 25 minutes and was wondering what was up.  Then my phone indicated I had a voice mail, though it had not rang.  I listened to it and it was the owner of this business telling me he had called the police because he couldn't get ahold of me. I was shocked and called back immediately.  I told him I had every intention of paying a fair price for his employees time and then asked what legal backing he had to call the police.  He continued threatening me with the police after I told him I would pay the 90$ for a couple gallons of gas and a half hour of his employees time.  No lock smith service had be provided.  I asked him if the police were coming to my home and what I would be charged for seeing as no crime had been committed at any point in time.  He  said he could do what he wanted and he didn't have to call them and tell them not to come if he didn't want to, this was after I had paid him mind you.  I ended up telling him if I had to deal with the police at all over this, that I would take some kind of legal action against him for extortion, slander, false claims etc. He said he didn't take kind to threats and would make sure the police came.  I called the state police and they said no one had called with such claims and if they had there wouldn't be much/anything they could do.  This man is despicable.

The view was okay facing the Strip, but the Strip was a long block away and the giganormous Planet Hollywood on the cross-street (Harmon Ave.) directly next to the tower was in some round-the-clock stage of construction.  (We happened to be there on opening night of PH, as well, so traffic was horrendous!)But I digress.  It was nice to have an actual balcony, although there was no outdoor furniture to sit on.  The interior of our simple, open square room was nice with dark wood and granite countertops in the kitchenette, which included a microwave, one-burner cool stovetop, half refrigerator, cookware, and utensils.  We also found lush king bedding, a clean and open bathroom with dual sinks, jacuzzi tub and separate shower all dressed in marble and granite.  All other kudos have been described by others already, but I'll add this list directly from The Signature's brochure:*Private check-in and check-out privileges through The Signature's lobby*Concierge in each tower*24-hour in-suite dining*Private heated pool complex*Poolside cabanas*Starbucks coffee shop*24-hour valet parking*Lobby Lounge*Fitness Center*24-hour bell staff*Business Center*Limo service*Same-day laundry and dry-cleaning services*Meeting spaceAlthough The Signature Towers are a 10-minute covered walk to the MGM and the Strip, as soon as you hit the MGM Grand Pool Area you have the MGM Spa and a number of eateries within a few feet of the The Signature private entrance.  Here we enjoyed lunch at 'wichcraft, which helped make up for not visiting Manhattan this year...and an incredible dinner at Seablue.  We also managed to squeeze in some spa treatments the morning of our departure.So why three stars?Service was spotty:  wonderful at times and downright rude at others.The computer systems seemed out of sync:  both my name and hubby's were supposedly in the system, but hubby was given a difficult time regarding services a couple times b/c they could not find him.  When they did find him, they did not apologize and simply continued to treat him as if he did not belong there.  Also, despite confirming a late check-out b/c of the spa treatments we had booked, we were both locked out of our room at the usual check-out time.The fragrance that funnels through the ventilation system caused allergies so intense that I was congested through dinner at Seablue and sneezing until I had a nosebleed.  I would prefer the hotels that claim to be smoke-free also be fragrance-free, but sleeping with the balcony door open helped.And that long walkway to get to the nightlife...well, you need to be prepared for it.  Many times we didn't ""go back upstairs"" b/c it was a hassle.  The Signature is a great place for privacy and business meetings, but if you want to partake of the Vegas scene, you probably would enjoy staying in the MGM Grand, where you still have easy access to the wonderful selection of MGM's 4- and 5-star restaurants and its shows, or elsewhere right on the Strip.

I like to use the hand towel size to towel dry my hair and wrap it up in a knot. I didn't bother calling housekeeping to bring one over as it was the last day by then and improvised with using the other bath towel.

Recently though, new properties have been emerging to offer an un-Vegas like experience.  No casino hotels.  No smoking hotels.  I have not stayed at many of these hotels (The Mandarin, Vdara), but my most recent Vegas stay was at The Signature at MGM Grand (which is business friendly and not like the mega casinos on The Strip).  The Signature is filled with spacious condos that are complete with kitchenettes, whirlpool bathtubs and (in some rooms) balconies.The Signature is located in the back of the MGM Grand.  It is attached to the MGM Grand via many airport-like automated walkways.  The hotel has very limited services.  There is a small lounge as well as an order-at-the-counter cafe.  For more dining options or expensive convenience store items, you are going to need to make the long trip to the MGM Grand.  This hotel does have its own pool as well as a 24-hour fitness center though it was difficult getting an open machine in the morning.The rooms at The Signature are nice.  The decor is up-to-date enough and the rooms are comfortable and very spacious.  Rooms come with kitchenettes, a big living area and a table (this creates a great pre-going out spot).  Rooms are also equipped with safes.  Room temperature was nice.There were a few minor negatives in the room.  It was difficult turning the TV off (it kept turning itself back on).  There were some missing items like no hotel directory to provide information on location of business center, fitness center and such.  No laundry bag either.Bathrooms are very big here.  Each room comes with a huge whirlpool tub as well as a big glass shower.  Unfortunately, the shower head had a very concentrated blast and not the widespread rain-like shower head many hotels are now featuring.  Getting the perfect water temperature in the shower was not easy either.Service was fine.Room rates at The Signature are typically higher than the MGM Grand, but they are not too expensive when compared to other similar properties along The Strip and it is less expensive than several of the upscale resorts on The Strip.I think how much you like The Signature is going to depend on what you are looking for in a Las Vegas hotel.  If you are looking for a good value room that is big and great for gatherings (as well as not next to a smoky casino), The Signature is a really good option.  If you want a more themed hotel as well as something that is convenient and a quick walk to the many other Las Vegas casinos, The Signature is probably not where you want to stay.I personally like having some of the niceties of The Signature like the big rooms and the non-smoking property, but given how far it is from The Strip, I would much rather stay at the Renaissance for a more business-like and less Vegas-like hotel experience, where I am getting the lower room rate as well as earning Marriott Rewards points.Complimentary valet parking is offered.  If you want complimentary self parking, you will need to park at the MGM Grand's parking structure, which is a very long walk to The Signature.",21,ZjSzUWHtnpCfjsa7CksSOg,11,5iL-XZulVa0myNa5gK6eeQ,1/12/2014,3,7,80,145 E Harmon Ave,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}, 'WiFi': 'free', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'BikeParking': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Hotels', 'Home Services', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Event Planning & Services', 'Home Cleaning', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Day Spas', 'Resorts']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.10625414,-115.1665862,The Signature at MGM Grand,Eastside,89109,1509,4,NV,Home & Service,Nevada,Anthony

When I moved in, a bonus was that it was a brand new property, now it's falling down and apart (cheap construction?). The residents are discourteous (loud music, don't pick up their dogs' feces, throw trash everywhere, their kids are often running around unsupervised, etc.) , visitors and/or people with multiple cars take up parking spaces without a decal, loud people in the pool/hot tub/workout rooms at all times of night, etc. and management does NOTHING. Any complaints are written down in a SPIRAL NOTEBOOK and from what I can tell are never followed-up on with any recourse to those that break leasing rules. I have been thoroughly disappointed by my residency here and have chosen to look elsewhere. I am counting down until my lease is up. In my research, I have found that the majority of properties in the area at or above AC's standard have rental rates at least a 100.00 LESS than they are still charging at AC! I am moving into a complex (approx. same age, quiet neighborhood, much more convenient highway access, positive online reviews ;) within a few miles and getting TWO BEDROOMS for the price I am currently being charged for ONE.  When I made the request to have my rental rate reviewed due to the competing market, of course, AC said no. It makes NO SENSE for me stay somewhere that is not even a pleasant place to live while being charged more than I have to be. This is the THIRD year in which there has been no decrease in my rent, therefore, it is probably safe to assume that AC does not care about loyalty AT ALL. They provide NO INCENTIVES to their residents.  There is no wonder you often see ""failure to pay rent"" notices on doors (again, indicating the types of residents AC may have routinely).

When the new management took over I really was wishing they can do a better job but instead I'm only getting this none stop nightmare almost monthly. Starting from September 2016, there was issue with my rent payment and long story short I got $100 credit in my account  and that ended up missing later on with no explanation(feels like they stole it) this apartment complex uses the weakest blind possible and when it's windy outside and I have my window open, the blinds break off from the top like crazy, since I moved in in July 2016, more than half of my blinds broke off and I never reported it cause it never bothered me much and I have a busy schedule so I just left it alone till October 2016 I finally decided to report it and have them fix it so I don't have sunlight blinding my eyes just by sitting in my living room. They came in to take a look at it while I was at work, and I received this call on November 1st from Trixi at the leasing office telling me to call back, I called after work and she was telling me the technician said the damaged was due to my cat and they will have to charge me for all the broken blinds. I found it unbelievable considered the blinds are broken off from the top and my cat is always locked in the cage during the night I'm not watching them and yes they do jump up to the window but it's physically impossible for him to break the blinds from the top, I explained to Trixi and I told her I'm not responsible for it and I'm not gonna pay for those blinds so she told me she will have to check with the technician and the manager and would give me a call back, so I went home and found out they've already put the new blinds up without letting me know. I had a very bad feeling already considered they told me they are charging. 3 days later I still haven't received any follow up so I decided to go in to talk to them in person, this time I got to speak with this older lady I forgot her name but I think she was the manager that gave me the worst attitude. I went in because first of all, I only put in the work order because the wind broke my blinds and I wasn't expecting any payments going out of my pocket, second if they called me and tell me to call back to discuss about this payment, I would assume it's them trying to see if I'm willing to pay or not; with them repairing the blinds without me authorizing the charges is just wrong. So I told the lady they can not charge me the money I didn't authorize, and she just kept on arguing with me calling me negligent to leave the window open and break the blinds. Excuse me for opening the window living on the third floor and needed some air coming in my apartment, we stood there and going back and forth for nearly 15 minutes listening to her bullshit, for one, I was trying to talk rationally and logically to her and she kept interrupting me was already highly unprofessional. I tried to talk some sense out of her and all she could tell me was ""we are not responsible for the breakage, you are because of your neglect."" Finally I was done cause she was obviously not listening to a word I was saying and I told her go ahead and take the blinds back, they didn't get my permission to fix it with a charge, they got the permission to come in and fix it yes but not with a charge. They should have let me know before they touched it if they were going to charge me. So now I feel like anything I report to them I have to be very careful cause they might just try to rip me off again. week later I went in to report my microwave broke and I spoke with Trixi again, she told me the blinds weren't charged. So here I was getting 2 different stories and had no idea what was the truth. Mid November I reported my microwave and waited for almost 3 weeks, no one showed up so I was out of microwave for nearly 3 weeks.

On Joy's recommendation I tried the tofu dog expecting it to taste like sawdust but it was actually the best fake dog I ever ate!  So that alone is worth three stars.  Now I'm willing to try other items from their deli.They have smoothies with soy milk instead of regular milk which is a plus for me but I don't drink smoothies anyway because that much fruit in a drink tends to go through me like a flare through the Hindenburg.Besides their deli, for additional instant gratification their cooler has things like hummus wraps and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  It's a small, quirky place to poke around.  You can browse the whole shop in about 45 seconds.  However, I'm a soy product fiend and I can't find that much to buy here.  They don't carry Amy's Kitchen frozen foods or anything else recognizable as healthy comfort food that I can buy to consume later.  My other big complaint is it can get a bit warm inside and I'm not sure what that does to the energy bars.  When I picked one up it felt squishy.  So the hypochondriac in me has written off ever buying energy bars or other shrink-wrapped-room-temp-limited-shelf-life-food from here.  They have a lot more natural supplements like acidophilus than I expected which is cool but I'm insanely loyal to the brand I buy (Florajen) and they don't carry it, probably because it has to be refrigerated.  There's no place inside to ""hang out"".  But there are always people coming and going.  If I knew what all the powders, grains and little vials of goo were maybe I would shop here more often.

You can point to the now demolished Charlotte Coliseum, which housed the long-gone Charlotte Hornets.  The only real problem with either?  Neither was uptown, and neither had luxury boxes.  The solution?  This $400 million version, with luxury boxes, that will allegedly spur development (development that was already under way).  Was it worth it?  You make the call.You can look at the location.  Right next to several parking garages, a couple of hotels and even a light rail stop, it is well-positioned.  Yet, just as with almost any other facility, there are backups when it lets out, and the spiderweb of one-way streets uptown can make getting in and and out (if you drive) a bit of a pain.  Any better if it were elsewhere?  Not really.  That just comes with the territory: Put thousands of people into a small space, and getting them all out in a rapid fashion is going to take time.But the facility itself is a nice one.  From the brick facade greeting you as you enter to each level of seats on the inside.  While there are your expensive seats and your nosebleed seats, each of them has an excellent view of the action.  If you are fortunate enough to get into one of those luxury boxes, you will have an outstanding one.  One thing is sure - for $400 million, you do get a nice arena.  Maybe I should build one.

Specifically, we had decided to install new laminate - which we didn't actually get here at Carefree Carpets, but that they would install for us - new carpet and new vinyl.  Plus new carpet for the room over the garage.All in all, it was a bunch of new flooring.We actually worked with David first to see if we could come up with something for the laminate (or some other option), and we looked at a ton of different options.  Unfortunately none of them really worked for us.  The problem is that we had several colors of wood - white, oak and a couple different cherry-like colors.  That means we needed something that had a variety of colors in them.  Not circus colors, mind you, but perhaps a variation in color, rather than a single color like an oak.Generally this meant a real wood, but that would have been too thick.  So we decided to keep looking.  We ended up also looking at Lumber Liquidators and a few other flooring places, but settled on a variety from Ollie's - not one of the closeouts, but one they keep in stock - and had Carefree Carpets install it for us.  In fact, they had to install some of it twice, because one of the other contractors dropped a tool on it and scratched it up pretty badly.  Both times they did a fine job.They even installed transitions - the piece that matches up different styles of flooring - and quarter rounds (shoe moulding) that was stained to match the laminate flooring that we had picked out.  Is it perfect?  Probably not.  But it looks awfully sweet.  Even the cable guy was in the other day and mentioned that it looks nice.  The cable guy?  Seriously?  Family, friends, sure.  But the cable guy?The carpet was a bit easier, but it was complicated by wrapping things around stairs, which can be a bit of a pain.  Still, it turned out great.  Perhaps the biggest surprise was the sheet vinyl in the laundry room, which looks like tile, and turned out better than we could have imagined.Once we were done, the old bathrooms (two ceramic tile and one vinyl) looked so bad we had to use some of our old ceramic tile and get those updated.  We had Carefree Carpets do this too.  Turned out great.Now why are they called ""Carefree Carpets"" when they also install laminate, tile and vinyl?  I have no idea.

Back in the day, you could actually window shop for things, but this is only in certain places in certain cities - and then perhaps only at certain times of year when the displays were changed out for something interesting. If you are actually shopping for windows, it is much, much worse.Champion is one of those names that you likely see about everywhere if you are in the market for windows. They send out flyers to everyone on your street. They advertise in the paper. They put ""coupons"" in the remodeling flyers. They have a booth at the remodeling shows. So we had them out. And their windows are not cheap, by any means. The one saving grace is that they do offer a lifetime warranty - on both parts and labor - and they have at least been around long enough that they will likely be there when you go to ask for service under said warranty.What I would suggest is not buying their windows at full price. Multiple times a year (maybe constantly) they run sales. Within those sales periods, they run other sales that are even better, such as ""buy X, get Y free"". Wait for those. Then be prepared to walk away, much as if you are car shopping. If you happen to be a previous customer, you can likely use this to your advantage and get the same pricing on a new batch of windows (hopefully your prior pricing was worth getting again).The windows themselves?

So as far as that goes, it's not quite as good as Hearth and Patio.However, the staff is so much better than Hearth and Patio, it's not even close - they are helpful, and give you advice, and help you figure out what you really want, rather than just trying to sell you something.

Or a few dozen.We ultimately decided to give into the monster and settled on Bank of America.  I mean if we're going to have a local presence, might as well have the biggest, right?I was in this area, so stopped in, which was good, because their other branches are usually slammed.  This one typically isn't.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's all the dancing statues of liberty from the tax place across the street.Setting up the business account wasn't hard.  Neither were the personal accounts, really.  The hardest part was navigating the endless suggestive sell process - do you want a debit card with that?  How about an extra account for your dog?  Finally managed to get it all done though.Then the real difficulty began: Transferring money.  It's been decades since I used a bank (vs. a credit union), so I don't know if the problem is one of being at a bank or at Bank of America specifically, but they want to hold everything.  Not reliably, however.The first person said that under a particular amount would go through.  So I get a cashiers check for that amount.  It's held until the next day.  I can deal with that.  Then I get another.  That one is held for three days.  Huh.  After that goes through, I get another.  That one is held for a week.  So I set up an online transfer.  This only allows a tiny amount to be transferred directly from the other account directly into the Bank of America account.  What a pain.Yes, I could get one whopping check for the entire amount - but what I want to know is why a cashiers check from another financial institution (again: not a personal check) is held at all, much less for varying amounts of time.  Because I need to pay bills, I can't transfer the entire amount at once, and I'd like to get as much as possible moved, while retaining access to my money.  But they don't like to allow that (this doesn't appear to be the fault of this location in particular).Finally, it seems that they didn't order the debit cards for the accounts like they said they would.  Had that done at another branch, who also let us know that we could get our pictures on them.  Didn't even know it was an option from this branch (this is the fault of this location).

In the end, it came down to two things that helped make the decision on which one to go with.The first part of the decision was the company who made us feel the most comfortable.  There are plenty of people who come in and try and sell you something.  But right off, Rodney Bradham made us feel like he wanted us to understand what we were getting (not an easy task), rather than just slamming in a new system.  That was a pleasant difference from most of the others who came in.The second was how long the company had been around.  It isn't much of a surprise to find that there are a lot of companies out there who will sell you just about anything, but Bradham Brothers had been around for a long time - nearly 30 years.

He cut the dimensions I needed perfectly and I was out the door in no time. I didn't have to do any math to get this done. *Bonus*I will be the first one to say, ""I'm not handy!""

It was so bad it felt as if they were trying to hide something.After turning in all the requested documentation I did not hear ANYTHING from them until one Wednesday I get a call saying my loan is ready to close, when can I do it, this Friday, this Saturday, or Monday? I told them I couldn't close on any of the days they offered nor could I do it next week as I would be out of town on work. Keep in mind, no one has called to review closing documents with me, to ask if I needed any explanation on the final costs, etc.The ""closing coordinator"" then informed me that my rate lock would expire next Friday and that she would have to talk to my loan officer, Bryan Partridge. That is when the high pressure, hard sales come into play. Bryan calls me and tells me that they would need to charge an 1/8 of a point if I wanted to extend the rate lock and that the rate lock had already been extended one week. WHAT?! I had never up to this point requested a rate lock extension, when did this happen?! ""Oh, we [roundpoint financial] had to extend it one week because we made a mistake in the processing of your loan,"" Bryan tells me. If they had not required that extra week, I could have closed when I was not working, had plenty of time to review and ask questions about the closing costs and documents, but no, I need to accommodate them, no accommodation for the customer. Geez, I should have charged them an 1/8 point! I tried to explain to Bryan that I will be working next week, so I will be too busy to go over the documents, etc. He keeps on reminding me that the rate lock has already been extended a week and I have to keep on reminding him that I didn't request that extension. Bryan says he will need to discuss this and he will call me back. He calls back and says if he can get the closing documents to me for me to review by Friday would that be okay, because he ""wants to work with me and accommodate [my] needs."" Yeah what a crock of $h!t. Of course, he doesn't get me the documents by Friday, instead he gets them to me Monday evening. Of course the documents are as clear as mud. Different figures and sums in different formats (HUD documents vs roundpoint documents) so trying to figure things out was very difficult.I was working in AZ and I had to work past 3 pm everyday so by the time I got off work, roundpoint financial was already closed on the east coast, so no one to answer any questions. I would email my ""senior"" loan officer, Bryan, but if and when he responded, he would often not answer all my questions or answer them very vaguely, e.g. ""we already discussed that."" I did get a closing requirements letter from their closing coordinator. On that letter, it was clearly stated I had the right to rescind the loan after closing, this made me feel a little better. That didn't last long. When it came time to finally sign the documents with the notary, it was a hot, sticky mess. Supplemental documents that were initially given to me to review, were not in the actual closing documents for me to sign and vice versa. The notary wanted me to sign documents that were not initially given for me to review. I told the notary I could always rescind, but the she, the notary, has to inform me that I could not since this was an investment property. I think that is p!$$ poor when the notary, who doesn't know anything about the closing costs, has to explain the details of the loan to me. Overall, if you do choose to work with this company be very cautious and suspect of everything they do. Do not be afraid to ask questions, demand answers, scrutinize numbers, or even walk away. I would avoid Bryan Partridge. Even though he is a ""senior"" loan officer, I think that means he is good at high pressure sales and avoiding questions.",45,l8WdId8Ya_wtV576khTfsA,0,by3ev4Q2PkCBK3bRZWaXgg,10/12/2013,1,2,-23,5032 Parkway Plaza Blvd,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Home Services', 'Mortgage Brokers', 'Real Estate']",Charlotte,"{'Friday': '9:00-17:00', 'Tuesday': '9:00-17:00', 'Thursday': '9:00-17:00', 'Wednesday': '9:00-17:00', 'Monday': '9:00-17:00'}",1,35.181658,-80.904886,Roundpoint Mortgage Company,,28217,84,1.5,NC,Home & Service,North Carolina,Jen

The store is impeccably clean and there are some sweet flatscreen TVs near the back of the store that you can oogle while you wait. It's important to note that every employee we worked with was super friendly, helpful and courteous. And dressed so nicely, natch!While the salespeople may lean hard on the iPhone, I was there to order my iPhone 4 anyway no hard pitch needed. Hubs and I worked with Tyler and Malcolm to transfer my old phone to hubs, set up family plan and order my new, shiny iPhone 4. Both of these guys were super patient and helped answer all of my (surely irksome) questions that I had. This AT&T store is sharp and inviting inside and out.

Woot.I rolled up to this BoA to grab some cash (many ATMs outside and drive through, folks) and more importantly, to acquire a certified check. These are the errands that I truly despise, because past experience has shown that certified checks can be obnoxious and take a while. Plus, I also needed a notary. Another potentially laborious process. But guess what? The very nice teller took care of my certified check in 5 minutes and directed me to their notary just a moment later. And the icing on the cake? The notary service was free.

This was the Ohio based branch that made my move and is the one that I am reviewing.-------This review represents the culmination of several months of wrangling with one of the worst companies I've ever had the DISpleasure of working with, and one of the most painful customer experiences that I've ever had in my life here on earth. I will break the review into a couple segments for clarity.This is a painful review to write, and I will make sure this review goes to both Angie's List and Yelp as well as Movers.com.Bullet Points:Overpromise, Underdeliver. High Pressure Sales tactics. Poor customer service and follow up. I quote: ""You'll be satisfied with our service. We'll make you happy. We're very proud of our Angie's list B+ rating""The Plan:Day 1: 8-12 am arrival, half day to pack.Day 2: Transport to target cityDay 3: 8 am delivery.Actual:Day 1 arrival: 4:30 pm. Stopped work at 10:30 pmPromised to restart packing at 8:00 am and finish by 10:30 the next day.Much wrangling with the operations part of their service who had very different sets of plans for us. Changes in pricing. Insurance offered. We ultimately took it due to the large numbers of disconcerting elements to the service. Call backs were not performed - we had to call them ourselves to finish conversations with the company. The team hadn't eaten all day, and were very fatigued upon arrival, so we fed them.Day 2 arrived at 8:20, finished packing 3:00 pm, after multiple push backs.My parents, in their 70s were to wait at target site. The personnel promised to be mindful of my parents age and assured us that they would update us if there would be further delays. At least to take care of my parents.Day 3: Texted to get information from personnel, and were told they'd be 20 minutes late since they had to get breakfast (reasonable). 9:30, still no arrival. Once they arrived, it became clear that they would not be able to complete the task themselves (these were not large, muscular workers) and we hired several additional workers to help them finish the job - with the help of building management.It is impossible to overstate how much we tried to inform the company the particulars of the new site, which were not internally conveyed to their moving team.Damages to several appliances and statues noted on arrival. Claims filed a little while after to their claims department. The claims were denied, but their email was sent to the wrong address and we never received follow up until we pursued the matter ourselves. They later told us they received a bounced email, but didn't bother to check the email address they had used to send to us.At any rate, all claims were denied as they don't cover appliances or statues - which was not made clear to us at time of purchase of insurance. What's the point of insurance if it doesn't cover anything?Phone calls from management were non-existent.Summary:Horrid experience.

The rooms I've stayed in had a kitchen with appliances, a sitting area with a L shaped couch that could be pulled out into a bed, and a huge Queen sized bed. The bathroom is decent sized with a shower-tub combo. The heating is a bit wonky and may or may not work as well as you'd like in the winter.

Most people who stay here are on business so it is pretty quiet. If you have a room that faces the street (Prospect Ave), you may hear loud music and patrons from nearby bars- especially from the one across the street that doubled as a venue for salsa dancing.:: Food ::If you're staying for a while, they do have the complimentary grocery shopping. They'll just add the grocery bill to your room. In the mornings,  they serve breakfast buffet style on the 2nd floor. Items include coffee, tea, juice, water, cereal, toast, muffins, yogurt, fruit, hot oatmeal, eggs, bacon, sausage, and the like. In the evening, they'll serve different dishes everyday during their ""social hour."" They also serve alcohol including red and white wine and beer on tap (usually a domestic like Miller and a Great Lakes brew). They also have their 24hr marketplace in the lobby where you can pick up stuff.:: Laundry ::They have a laundry room on site. However, it was malfunctioning the few times I used it so I don't recommend it.:: Gym ::They do have a mini gym in the hotel. Not sure if it is still the case, but hotel guests were allowed to use the gym in the arcade/mall next door by showing their key cards. :: Parking ::This is one of the scariest lots I've ever encountered.

Some ups and downs with this company--to be fair, a lot of the issues my husband and I endured were caused by Lumber Liquidators' lack of transparency and poor management of their vendor--but overall satisfied with N&M.Positives first.  The 3 men who put in our floor did a great job.  Ed seemed to be the one in charge, and the guys were fast workers.  Each day they commuted from OH to my house outside of Pittsburgh, arriving a little before 8AM and wrapping up at 2-something in the afternoon.  On the 3rd and final day they finished up around noon.  I appreciated that they did a sufficient quick clean-up before leaving each day.  The guys were fun and pleasant and since I work from home asked if I was OK with their playing music and if the music was too loud.  I actually got a kick out of the music--mostly 80s rock and pop hits, and the guys had a tendency to sing along.  One negative was that we didn't have the best experiences with Tony, who did the initial consultation and was our N&M contact prior to the start of the job.  Consultation went fine, but then Tony was nearly impossible to reach.  Calls and texts went unanswered, and Tony insisted that he didn't receive our messages.  There was a period of time when we couldn't even get a definitive confirmation of the work start date.  Lumber Liquidators and the N&M secretary apologized profusely and assured us that Tony would soon respond.  It got pretty bad, but eventually Tony got back in touch with us and made a second trip to our home to inspect post-demo--we saved close to $3,000 by removing the old hardwood ourselves--and to confirm that everything was ready for the installation.Another negative, though not as frustrating as the first, involved the installation of some of the bamboo, from an aesthetic standpoint.  The vast majority of our bamboo was a darker color, but in our many boxes there were also some lighter-colored planks.  Ideally the lighter planks would have been mixed in with the darker planks in a way that I like to describe as ""perfectly random,"" similar to how boxes of tiles are shuffled prior to installation.  That wasn't done, so the result in my living room is a very large section of all-dark bamboo and then a few oddly placed lighter planks.  When I first addressed this with the crew there was some frustration, then understanding, and then no further issues with the rest of the hardwood installation.  If you have strong feelings about your floor being ""perfectly random"" or another preference, then I urge you to very clearly discuss your expectations before the work starts.There was an awkward moment at the end of the job when it was time to write the check to N&M.  The paperwork I received via USPS prior to the start of the job quoted a price that included materials and labor, but the price at the end of the job was considerably more.  Whoever prepared the early paperwork had neglected to factor in labor costs.  Ed made a quick phone call, and N&M honored the lower price.  No complaints there!Good company.  This review would have been an easy 4 stars had Tony been more reliable and communicative.",10,wQRKJskmPlpB_scSyIjaTg,7,tlAeGFC8xkXMEgu757hE1A,4/4/2016,3,2,20,,{'ByAppointmentOnly': True},"['Flooring', 'Home Services', 'Contractors']",Kent,{},1,41.1536674,-81.3578859,N&M Floors,,44240,4,2,OH,Home & Service,Ohio,Kristin

Finally, something with new finishes, open layouts, high ceilings, a nice walk-able location, and still has some old-school charm and architecture.The staff is fantastic, friendly, professional and helpful. They've worked hard to ensure that I'm happy, and are quite responsive to issues. I had some noise problems with HVAC that required substantial trial and error, but they were persistent until it was resolved.The neighbors are friendly, fun, and... neighborly. Its nice that the management often has social events for the tenants so you can meet each other.Utilities are pretty inexpensive. I have a 2br, and the highest the heating/electric bill went (with Ethical Electric Green Energy) in January was 740kWh, about $100. Not bad! Water is fixed and included with rent as a fee.However, the building is not without some quirks and issues:* There aren't lights where there really ought to be - like in a dark, isolated hallway closet where you can't see your clothes.  Or above where the dining room table should go! * The floors aren't real hardwoods, they're cheap laminate. At least I don't have to worry about scratching them.* The paint on the walls somehow marks with the slightest scratch or brush up against it. Its like they put on a single coat, and the paint has carbon or something to show wherever it was touched.* The elevator has a beautiful glass wall in it, yet the windows to the exterior are covered in either bird poop or concrete droppings. Visitors are like ""OOOOhhh!"" followed by ""Eeeeewwww"". Its kind of embarrassing. * The place is locked up like Fort Knox. Its nice that it is secure, but holy cow, its super annoying if you're trying to host a party. You or somebody have to go down the elevator to let somebody in EVERY TIME. There is no way to buzz somebody up. Going from the lobby entrance to your unit requires at least 3 badge swipes. Garage to the unit requires FIVE badge swipes! (Garage entrance, garage vestibule, lobby vestibule, lobby, elevator). I curse out loud every time I have to walk in carrying something. Really, they need to make a real security desk in the lobby.* Lots of construction noises due to East Liberty Transit Center renovations. This usually starts around 7:30am every day. This isn't in the property's control, but something to consider about location. With East Liberty projects scheduled all around us, I don't expect outside noise to be getting better within the next few years.* The pet fee is insanely high. 1/2 a month rent for a cat?! I paid it, because I love my cat, but there is no way she could possibly do that much damage to an apartment for any amount of time. It isn't even refundable. Silly.Overall, I'm happy with the place and the problems above are most definitely ""first world problems"", but for the price premium that we pay for a luxury apartment, I expect a little more.

While the owner, JC was very friendly and helpful in setting everything up on the phone, and they were available the day I needed on fairly short notice, so many things went wrong and my move was extremely stressful. The movers arrived late. They used my tools to disassemble furniture, dumped a socket set everywhere, and didn't organize them. Packing went way over the expected time, past my management companies hours, at which point they were going to charge me extra. Movers started rushing, being careless. They left many items behind, completely didn't pack a closet. I ended up spending several hours moving stuff they missed. Movers got into a verbal altercation at the moving truck with each other. I had to walk away because I thought they may start physically fighting. They crammed stuff completely wall-to-wall in the elevator, knocked off the protective mats. At the destination, the movers tried moving the truck while the ramp was attached, and ended up hitting a neighbor's truck with the ramp. Amazingly, it didn't appear to cause damage. Again, I had to walk away because I just couldn't watch them. At the destination, the movers requested that I unload a wardrobe box so they could re-use it (seriously?) I complied, and when I came back downstairs, I noticed the strong smell of gas in the kitchen. One of the movers had bumped the knob on the range, left it pouring gas into the kitchen, and NOBODY NOTICED!? THE MOVERS NEARLY BLEW UP MY NEW HOUSE! Liquor bottles were packed upside-down, leaking everywhere. Water left in a kettle when it was packed - everything was wet. Original canvas paintings were placed in a wardrobe box, no protection from each other, and damaged due to the corners of each other. Basically all but one of my lamps were broken. Broken glasses, bowl, missing parts to my keyboard stand &amp; coffee table, scratched my desk, damaged the apartment walls. A wall clock went completely missing. None of the boxes were labeled, so at the destination, everything ended up on the first floor except for wardrobe boxes - many of which didn't actually contain clothes. I was moving boxes up and down constantly during unpacking. On the plus side, I was reimbursed for the lost/damaged items. It took a month and a half to get the check, but I did.

The corporate apartment comes with a fullsized fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, silverware, platewear, pots and pans.  There is also an iron and ironing board.  There is also a 22 inch? CRT-TV with about 100 cable channels.  I had a router for internet but it was taken away from me 2 weeks into my stay.  The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took it away without even telling me.  They did not offer me a chance to pay for it.The fitness room was nice.  There are treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, and other various machines.  There are even a few sets of dumbells.  I never used the sauna, so I cannot comment on that.There is a 24 hour concierge that is always helpful and friendly.  There is also an option to sign up for a dry-cleaning service, which is outsourced to another company.  You drop your dirty clothes into a room and pick it up a few days later after it has been cleaned.  This is rather expensive as well.  Everyone who has a dry-cleaning Key has access to this room.  Thieves could come in and steal your clothes.If I had an option, I would not stay at the Pennsylvanian again.",5,vIKhXVBZZc0IwiHNBXK7Mg,3,Wn3i2SlQdXqA-zql14zB4g,8/12/2009,2,1,7,1100 Liberty Ave,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Home Services', 'Apartments', 'Real Estate', 'Real Estate Services']",Pittsburgh,"{'Monday': '9:00-18:00', 'Tuesday': '9:00-18:00', 'Friday': '9:00-18:00', 'Wednesday': '9:00-18:00', 'Thursday': '9:00-18:00', 'Saturday': '9:00-16:00'}",1,40.444228,-79.9922328,The Pennsylvanian Apartments,Downtown,15222,5,2,PA,Home & Service,Pennsylvania,Alexander

My move from start to finish was riddled with mistakes, some minor and some major, and it made my move from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia all the more stressful. Allegheny Valley Transfer (AVT; via Allied) was unprofessional, unable to communicate (with me or to each other), and unwilling to make things right when they made mistakes. The following is a detailed account of what happened.I first called Allied and explained to them that I lived in a 3-bedroom house but had roommates and the move would be one of the three bedrooms, that I had very little in the way of common area furniture and any of the things I had in the common areas were minimal and could be put in about 5 boxes max. They said great, they'd have people come to estimate what the cost would be, and we set up an appointment.The estimators come, and they seem surprised because they have been told that it was 3-bedroom house but none of the other details (Mistake 1). But otherwise, it's fine, they carry on and I point out all of things that are mine that I'm taking with me. I tell them I want all the bells and whistles: I want them to pack my things, I want them to move my things, I want them to unpack my things. The estimators also say great, and tell me that I don't even have to take things out of my drawers, they'll take care of all of that. The only thing I have to do is keep the things that are mine in the common area in one space so that it'll be easier for them to distinguish between what stuff is mine versus my roommates. Reasonable, of course, and I think great, that's what I want. They give me an estimate.They send me the paperwork the next day and ask when I want them to pick up my things, when I say, well how long will it take to be delivered? They say, ok tell us a range of days you want it to be delivered and we'll tell you when it should be picked up. I tell them Mon, June 19 - Wed, June 21. They say, we can do a 5-day spread instead, so Mon, June 19 - Fri, June 23. I say that's fine, and they say they'll pick up Thurs, June 15. Perfect, I say, and I book my flight accordingly (originally planned on Sunday night but decided Saturday night based on price).Two days before they're supposed to pick up my stuff, I realize there's no time window for pick-up, so I call and ask and they say they'll have the movers call me closer to then, but that the earliest it would be is 12pm because they have other pick-ups that day. Ok, that's a pretty big window but fine.They never called, but the night before my move, I stayed up late putting together some of my things from the common areas and planned to get up and do a couple more hours of work before the movers arrived. The next morning I woke up at 8:50am to pounding on my door. They were over 3 hours early from the earliest time they estimated (Mistake 2). Turns out they were also never told about packing my things so they had to scrounge up any boxes they had in the truck (Mistake 3) -- thankfully, I did not have much stuff for them to pack, but they moved incredibly slowly, at one point one of them even took a 10 minute phone call followed by a bathroom break (Mistake 4).Because a 5-day spread is a long time, I figured the movers would have a better idea of when they'd arrive by now, so I asked: Do you have a better idea of when I'll receive my stuff? Yes, they say, SATURDAY, June 17 in the morning (Huge Mistake 5)!! I had already booked my flight and my new apartment did not do weekend moves (issues with freight elevators etc.).By this point, I am livid, but after a ton of hassle and back and forth with my apartment building and AVT, I had to change my flight at my own cost so that I could arrive by the time the movers would; otherwise, I would have to wait 2 weeks to get my stuff! AVT was unapologetic and even unwilling to provide any discounts for the major inconvenience. Finally, I got the apartment building to ok a 4-5pm freight elevator time, and I called both AVT and the actual movers to make sure they would make it at that time.When I arrived in Philadelphia, I cleaned my place then went to Target, planning to buy some things before the movers arrived in a few hours. They arrived WITHOUT NOTICE at 1:20pm, expecting to be let in (Mistake 6). By the end of it, I was so fed up that I did not even point out that they were also supposed to unpack for me (Mistake 7).Also, it's been a week and a half and I have yet to receive a receipt (though I know my credit card was charged) and I have yet to receive a claims form (Mistakes 8 and 9), which I need because they broke my mirror frame (ha, Mistake 10).My entire experience with Allegheny Valley Transfer was miserable, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

The deal was great on its own, but after an additional LivingSocial promotional savings I ended up getting 2 hours of moving services (with 2 movers) for just $64, tip not included.  After working our butts off packing everything up in San Diego, my husband and I looked forward to doing a lot less physical labor on the other end of our move, in Pittsburgh in frigid February!A.K. Vance, with whom I spoke on the phone on several occasions before and after purchasing the LivingSocial deal, was incredible--professional, knowledgeable, kind voice.  He answered all my questions more than adequately and made me feel comfortable with my purchase by assuring me there was a good chance the company/movers would work with us should any unforeseen issues or timeline changes arise, just so long as we alerted them to any changes ASAP.  (Basically, I got the impression that CLS's 24-hour cancellation policy is more flexible than the fine print implies.)  Thank you very much for your superior customer service, Mr. Vance.I wish the movers had been more proactive, more intuitive.  The pair of guys who were our hired labor were nice enough, respectful enough, and strong enough, but they relied heavily on our directions when moving the more challenging pieces of furniture.  Just over half of the 2-hour job was spent trying to get the largest piece of our sectional sofa into the elevator, out of the elevator, and into the apartment.  When the movers appeared defeated and out of options early on during the couch battle my husband stepped in to offer his suggestions and after little progress had one of the movers stand aside so that he could attempt some techniques himself.  Frankly, I was surprised how quickly the movers seemed to give up and how much sweat my guy ended up having to put into the job in order to exhaust all options.  After the couch sustained some damage and it seemed the couch could not possibly make the angle required to get it through the door, I made the executive decision to discard the couch.  Bummer, but a decision I can live with.I would possibly hire Comprehensive Labor Solutions again for future moving needs; however, I'd hope and expect to see more proactively on the part of the movers.  Also, a nice bonus would be if CLS could implement some kind of complimentary removal or donate service for pieces of furniture they are unable to move.",7,rrbqgO_atoJ_mYaOOxWjkg,3,lg-zr6wVBYmta9UBKvT23Q,4/28/2014,3,2,31,812 Cedar Ave,{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True},"['Home Services', 'Movers', 'Contractors']",Pittsburgh,{},1,40.48247052,-80.06698608,Comprehensive Labor Solutions,,15212,3,1.5,PA,Home & Service,Pennsylvania,Kristin

When in doubt in such cases I go with 3 stars.Husband and I browsed this store several times this spring and summer and then visited several more times throughout September and October as we moved forward with our purchase and the work associated with our foyer tile job.  Here you'll find tile from various categories--natural stone, faux wood, ceramic, etc.I'll get the bad out of the way first:* Our experiences with The Tile Shop employees were mostly positive.  The exception was a male associate who followed us around the store and refused to accept the fact that we were just browsing and that, well, we no longer wanted to talk to him after the first few minutes.  My husband then pulled the jerkiest move by walking ahead and leaving me with the guy!  Thanks, darling.  The employee then followed just a step or two behind me, at one point speaking to me in what I can only describe as baby talk.  Unbelievable.  Presumably, commission here is a big deal.  * You (or your contractor) need to pick up your own tile, and The Tile Shop calls often to remind you. * The Tile Shop works with a short list of contractors, experts the business has vetted and stands behind.  When we purchased our tile in September we were told that all 5 contractors--apparently the list had recently been reduced from 8 to 5 due to some poor reviews--were booked until December.  Bummer.  In any event we were given the list of contractors and were able to set up a complimentary consultation with a contractor on short notice.  During one of the calls from The Tile Shop (see 2nd bullet point above) my husband mentioned that we'd met with a particular contractor but that we hadn't yet decided to move forward.  Soon thereafter the contractor called us to say that he received a call from The Tile Shop asking when he was going to pick up our tile.  We hadn't hired the guy, so needless to say The Tile Shop put everyone in an awkward position.  Turns out The Tile Shop doesn't get paid until the tile order is picked up, so hence the moderate harassment.* Don't bother purchasing small supplies such as tile spacers and grout sealer here unless you don't mind paying a premium.   And now the good:* Alycia assisted us with our purchase and was really nice and helpful, truly a breath of fresh air compared to our interactions with the aforementioned associate.* After our job was complete we only had a few partial pieces of tile left, so we needed to order more for spares.  Scott was very helpful in tracking down tile from the same dye batch, and we were grateful that he gave us a good deal on a couple spare boxes.  * The Tile Shop offers complimentary classes/workshops, though we didn't take advantage of those due to our other priorities.* I love our tile and the price we paid for it. We purchased our faux wood ceramic tile, the admixture, and the grout from The Tile Shop.  All the other tools and supplies we either had on-hand, borrowed, or bought at Home Depot.  Ended up doing the tile job (demo and installation) ourselves, with the help and guidance of a handyman.  The job took a long time compared to the ~3 days it would have taken a contractor to pound it out, but on the upside we saved money and I was able to meticulously lay out every tile the way I wanted.  If you check out my photos, you'll see that our tile has a funky vibe and that there's great potential for inadvertently repeating patterns.  A contractor most likely would have done the standard mixing of the tiles from the various boxes but wouldn't have bothered to lay out the entire design in an artistic way.  In hindsight and though the job was dirty and stressful, I love that we did it and especially that I can say that I chose exactly where every single piece of tile went.  My only regret is that we didn't go with a darker grout.  The Whisper Gray color grout that we chose appeared to be a medium gray in the store, but the end result looks almost white-light.The Tile Shop is a good option for tile and has decent prices, especially when it comes to Manager Specials.

For one of the inspections/homes we'd scheduled the 3-part inspection with Andy quickly after receiving the green light from the selling agent, though we had a feeling that the seller's pain-in-the-ass relocation company might change their mind at any moment.  (As a side note, I hate SIRVA.  They were as inefficient to work with as I can possibly imagine.)  We were transparent with Andy about everything, and, sure enough, were told we couldn't enter the property on the agreed upon date to perform the inspections...even though the confirmation had been received days before, all plans were in place, and the sellers were out of town.  We stayed in close contact with Andy throughout one exceedingly stressful morning as we awaited SIRVA's final confirmation to proceed with the inspection.  Andy was gratuitous with the deadline he gave us and then was OK with keeping the inspection as scheduled even though the final confirmation came about 30 minutes past the deadline.  We were so grateful and even brought Andy a bottle of wine to express our gratitude.Really liked Griffin Inspection Services' web systems such as the emails/notifications and the e-signing process.  Very user-friendly and organized.One minor gripe related to our experience:  we were charged and paid $500 for the 3-part inspection, but later when reviewing paperwork I noticed that we had agreed to a price of $475.Andy is a people person--easy to talk to and friendly.  We learned a lot from him and enjoyed our in-person time with him, about 7 hours total.  He's clearly knowledgeable, handy, and likes what he does for a living.

There was some of that.Anyway, as a previous reviewer commented, a three-hour delivery window is a little annoying, but it worked out and I ended up using that extra time to clean and up the odds of recouping my deposit!And once the guys got there, they just didn't stop.

There were two things that distinguished Noosa from other pest control companies: 1) Local and 2) Eco-friendly practices.

I thought that company's price was a little high and I am unsure if they are even still around.  I really dislike calling the big AC places that have TV commercials because they often are commissioned and try to sell you unnecessary stuff,  It's the same reason I take my car to a local mechanic.  Anyway, our AC just did not seem to be working as efficiently as it should, so I gave NASCAIR a call based on Yelp reviews and a friend's recommendation.  They sent a guy out who checked the Freon levels, temperatures, main unit, and coil.  Everything was functioning normally and the Freon was only about a half pound low.  He said that the maximum temperature an AC unit in the Charlotte area can handle is 93 degrees and that an AC unit can only cool to a maximum of 20 degrees.  With the hotter than usual weather this summer, it was normal for our AC to be running constantly and not cooling below 80 degrees during the day.  Since the weather will be cooling soon, he said he could install the Freon (which is expensive) or wait until the springtime and have them check it again.  I chose the latter and will definitely be giving these guys a call.  Total price for this thorough service call where I was not even attempted to be upsold anything?  85 bucks.  If you need HVAC service, give this company a call.  It is great to know that places like this that don't have to put thousands of dollars into stupid commercials still exist.

Did you offer too much for the house? Can you find a lower interest rate? Should you try to negotiate the origination fee? And of course you need to have the house you want to buy inspected. So you ask your friends who they used (since Yelp has very few inspector reviews) but chances are they can't really remember anything about it. So you make a call.  $400 for an inspection!!!

He only schedules 2 inspections a day (which is unusual, most inspectors do many more) so he can spend more time on each one and can spend more time writing up your report. He walked me through everything at the house I was buying and gave me a sense of how important each issue was (note: inspectors write up every single thing that's wrong: never have a house inspector over for dinner, they will see every flaw in your house). He answered all of my asinine questions and never rolled his eyes at me. His full report came through within 3 hours and was very detailed including pictures.

It feels more like an apartment than a hotel, because FOR A CHANGE, the bathroom is located near your bedroom.  When you wake up, you pass your sink, jump in the shower, and a quick 180 degree turn from your sink is the closet.  It's a refreshing design that makes you feel at home, instead of having to go all the way to your front door.2)   There is a pretty spacious kitchen in each room, with a microwave, fridge and sink.  I'm not really sure people want to cook a meal in their hotel rooms, but I were the kind of person that wanted to reheat restaurant leftovers, or microwave popcorn, this setup is ideal.3)  A breakfast buffet is included, and they rotated the food every day!  It was shocking, in a good way.  One day was breakfast burritos, the other day was eggs benedict, and yet another day was a egg McMuffin kind of breakfast sandwich.  I never saw the same food twice, and I liked how juice, coffee and water were all self-service.  If I want another orange or cranberry juice, I don't necessarily have all day to wait to find one.

The place was incredibly dirty, even though I moved in two days after my lease had started. There were cobwebs everywhere, so much dust that I started coughing, dirt and other particles all over the floor, and of course, the actual structure and appliances were in disrepair. The tubs and sinks were peeling, there were rusted out drawers in the kitchen, soap scum that would not come out of the bathroom fixtures, and lights that were not operational/rusted over. It was shocking, but I wrote to the property manager and they agreed to compensate me. However, it was a negotiation, and the property manager told me there was no way that the place required 8+ hours of cleaning at their professional rate stated in their lease.Turns out, my upstairs neighbors had the same issue and moved into a filthy place. They were compensated double what I received.Then, it was an uphill battle trying to get the owner of the property to fix anything inside. They said it would cost too much money and they needed the place to be empty and to raise rent before they could fix anything. (Funny thing is, I moved to a place in the same neighborhood for the same price that is MUCH newer, cleaner, etc., and it is the same price!) Therefore, I was left with many of the issues I mentioned above, but with no effort on the part of the owner to fix anything.On top of that, their maintenance staff was usually very kind, but there were some times when they (or people they contracted to fix things) would come in and track mud around the apartment and/or damage my belongings. I had to have MPM pay for a new trash can because they broke the lid!In addition, once October rolled around and they started asking about renewing the lease, MPM began their showings. Other landlords in Madison (like my current landlord) try to schedule their showings in fairly short increments (30 mins or so) and on the same day/time period. MPM would block off hour-long periods at inconvenient times (e.g. 5:45pm on a Friday, 10am on a Saturday) and on consecutive days instead of one day (for instance, the company I currently rent with seems to go to certain properties on certain days of the week). It was incredibly difficult to feel like you were living in your own home. There were also incidents where a misunderstanding with the person showing the home led to unpleasant situations; this was mainly due to problems that MPM had with their keys to the place. In response, I would be asked to keep certain doors unsecured so staff could conduct showings, etc. It was incredibly frustrating, since this was an issue that was out of my hands.Finally, after move-out, I was told that the apartment required 7 hours of professional cleaning at the rate of $39.50. This was after I cleaned the apartment extensively over the course of three days; I estimate that I spent about 10 hours at the place Swiffering, vacuuming, getting on my hands and knees to use wood cleaner for the baseboards, floors, doors, shelves, etc., thoroughly cleaning the kitchen and bathroom appliances, and even using the wood solvent/cleaner on the windowsills and inside of the windows. The truth is, the place is incredibly old and dust keeps on accumulating; in fact, pieces of the ceiling/walls seemed to continually break off a little at a time and land on my furniture. I also noticed that dirt was being tracked in during showings, which were consistently happening while I was in the process of cleaning/moving out. However, they were convinced that they would charge me for 7 hours of professional cleaning.When I compared the photographs I took of my initial move-in, I could see a lot of similarities to the kinds of problems they photographed (e.g. a scratch on the wooden floor, yellowing of the tiles on the wall, dirt on the outside of the window -- which isn't the tenant's responsibility since it is on the outside of the building, etc). They were unwilling to admit that I needed 8+ hours of cleaning and did not compensate me fairly at move-in. In fact, my building manager specifically said my documentation did not prove that the apartment required 8+ hours of cleaning. However, the photographic evidence presented at move-out, which they claim amounts to 7 hours of cleaning, is definitely nowhere near as bad as the state of the apartment at move-in. The amount of cleaning supplies used (one big packet of Swiffer wet wipes, almost an entire bottle of wood cleaner, multiple rounds of emptying the vaccum, a whole box of wipes, about 2/3 of a bottle of all-purpose Windex, 2/3 of a pumice stone for the toilet, a substantial amount of bleach and bathroom cleaner, oven cleaner, multiple Magic Erasers, etc.) makes me skeptical about their claims.I hope to contest this with MPM and find a resolution that is amenable to both parties. We'll see what happens.

I delivered my incredible baby boy at this hospital and I've since been getting into the routine of being a mommy.My experience with labor and delivery at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea was top notch.  Everyone from the administrative people who I checked in with, to all of the doctors and nurses were amazing.  I went through 3 shifts of nurses during my labor/delivery, and they were fabulous!  My anesthesiologist was incredible too - thank goodness for that epidural!  And best of all, my OB/GYN was there for my actual delivery.  Once Mav made his appearance, we stayed at the hospital another 48 hours or so, and all of the hospital staff we dealt with there were wonderful as well.  One thing to note is that this hospital does not have a nursery.  Once your baby arrives, you are in the same room as the baby... nurses are there to help, but you can't just ""send the baby to the nursery,"" as I hear you can do at other hospitals.  I was sleep deprived, but I didn't mind this as I was able to bond with Maverick right away.Other perks that I was impressed with were the size of the rooms, the fact that everything appeared clean and sanitized, the ""room service"" from the hospital cafeteria, the snacks available to patients, the videos available to help prepare you for being a parent, etc... but again, I cannot stress enough how impressed I was with the nurses.  Special kudos to Pam for getting me started and visiting after the baby came, Maggie for coaching me through the pushing, Cassie for her integral help post delivery, and all of the rest of the staff who I can't mention by name because I was in a drugged / hormonal state during my stay at this hospital.I'm not a huge fan of hospitals in general, but again, I had a fabulous experience here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hospital to anyone.",21,rkRYZq3ztIc1IEJ_FzpZsg,17,BL9ZQwgS0L1piT6-bnc6kw,9/15/2011,5,8,49,9003 E Shea Blvd,"{'AcceptsInsurance': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True}","['Doctors', 'Health & Medical', 'Hospitals', 'Emergency Rooms']",Scottsdale,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,33.580069,-111.8851432,HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center,,85260,149,3.5,AZ,Health & Medical,Arizona,Gabi

This was because we noticed that at three and four years old, she was having difficulty pronouncing certain letters and sounds.We were referred to PSLS from our pre-school director and had an initial evaluation in July of 2017.    Sure enough, the evaluation concluded that speech therapy ""appears medically necessary due to an articulation disorder.""  It was recommended that our daughter participate in 30-minute sessions of speech therapy for a minimum of two sessions per week, as well as practicing at home.As a result of the evaluation, we also learned that there was no reason our daughter couldn't easily catch up to age appropriate verbal communication in a reasonable amount of time.  We also learned there were no physical barriers stopping our daughter from pronouncing anything, which was a relief.   In reading everything I've written above, it sounds very serious and clinical and like there is a major issue at hand.  Luckily, that is not so... our daughter is perfect (at least in my eyes) and while maybe she doesn't annunciate every word as she should, she sounds like any other four year old out there.  She just needs to practice a little bit more and luckily, she has grown to love going to her speech sessions with Miss Amy, her therapist.PSLS does a great job of balancing a warm and friendly environment with a team of professionals who are super knowledgeable in their field.  They can speak in layman's terms to the patients and parents but obviously have a clinical background as well.I've been pleased with the staff working with my pediatrician and insurance company as well as with the progress I've seen to date with our sessions.While I hope that my daugher will ""graduate"" and no longer need therapy after a few more months, I'm grateful to have found PSLS, to help bring her up to speed before she enters elementary school.If you are seeking a place to take a child who may need some therapy or are curious to get an evaluation, PSLS is a practice I'd definitely recommend.",8,neWZEEU_EfdlwEEOD5-9oQ,7,z2JC6nnmDo7lebTYfjBPiw,10/5/2017,5,4,33,"6865 E Becker Ln, Ste 101","{'AcceptsInsurance': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': True, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True}","['Education', 'Specialty Schools', 'Speech Therapists', 'Health & Medical']",Scottsdale,"{'Friday': '8:00-18:00', 'Tuesday': '8:00-18:00', 'Thursday': '8:00-18:00', 'Wednesday': '8:00-18:00', 'Monday': '8:00-18:00'}",1,33.5832052,-111.9342676,Pediatric Speech and Language Specialists,,85254,6,3.5,AZ,Health & Medical,Arizona,Gabi

I chose feet.  Deep exhale.  No words can explain how amazing this was.  I didn't want my time to end, but it did... :(And as I type this, I wish that Alvea Spa was just a bit closer to home.  However, if it were, I could see spending a lot of time and money there, so maybe (for the sake of my checkbook), it's a good thing it's not!  Regardless, if you live, work, or play anywhere near Peoria, go pay this spa a visit.

We were really looking forward to spending a few hours being pampered, perhaps working out a bit, sitting by the pool, etc... and we did all that - it just didn't WOW me as much as I thought it would for the price I paid.First of all, I was very clear when I made the appointments that my friend was pregnant and so I requested a prenatal massage for her.  I requested a deep tissue massage for myself.  I was pleased that they called the day before to confirm our appointments.  We checked in about an hour before our scheduled massages and the lady looked at us both and asked ""so, you both have prenatal massages, correct?""WHAT?  NO!  I looked down at my belly and said - nope - she has a prenatal massage and I requested a deep tissue massage.  Not a huge deal and probably not the girl's fault, but that is not a mistake to make to someone who is weight-conscious and far from prego!No big deal... we're here to enjoy and relax.  Deep breath, Gabi... :)So we are given a tour of the facility (which is beautiful, peaceful, tranquil, etc...) and we decide we have time for a walk before our massages.  So, we go outside and make our way around the hotel a bit.  There is a bunch of construction, so we turn around and go through the hotel and try to go to the back pool area to check it out.  Nope... the pool attendant says that spa guests cannot enter that pool area (not even for a walk) - you must be a hotel guest to enter.  OK then, we turn around and head back to the spa.With about a 1/2 hour before we need to be ready for our massages, we decide to get in a quick workout in the fitness center.  It is clean, spacious for a hotel facility, and has all the equipment you need.  This was a positive, as was the actual spa pool and jacuzzi, sauna, etc...Once we are in our robes and slippers, we head upstairs for our treatments - the waiting room is very well-done with comfy couches, chairs, blankets, plenty of magazines, relaxing music, and lots of treats (fruit, tea, water, trail mix, etc.)The services didn't blow either of us away and for what we paid, we each could've gotten 4 massages each at Massage Envy instead.  But, again, it was about the day as a whole and the spa experience.  So, we enjoyed a lovely lunch from the Spa Bistro and sat out by the pool in the afternoon.  Not such a bad day after all - I just really wanted a 5 star experience for what we paid, and I can't give more than 4.  However, it is hit or miss, so I encourage you to check it out yourself.  As for me, I'll happily return if someone else is paying.

Well, I can say with confidence that they achieved their goal...During our visit, Mav had his teeth brushed and shined.  They counted his teeth (18 to date), and Dr. Bienstock looked at them to make sure all was well.  The staff members that we interacted with (Perla and Kelly), as well as those at the front desk, were friendly, patient and encouraging throughout our visit.  They were amazing with kids and knew exactly how to put my son at ease as they introduced their tools and did his dental exam / cleaning.  They were also extremely thorough in making sure I knew exactly how to have him brush his teeth, etc...In addition to the actual ""in room"" visit, Mav played in the rocket ship, played games on the many ipads, went down a slide, and explored!  He was also given lots of presents including a new toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, a huge cup for water, a big red balloon, and a handful of other toys too.DRPD exceed our expectations during our visit and I know that Mav's teeth are in good hands with Dr Bienstock and her staff.

The key with Massage Envy is finding a good therapist, and I've found that over time the therapists at Massage Envy seem to come and go often, so it's always a challenge to find a therapist that you really like.I happen to like very deep massage, and I usually don't have a preference between a male and female therapist... so when i called last week to make an appointment for a very much needed massage, I trusted the front desk person who put me with Tori. And OUCH - Tori delivered a very deep massage.  (OUCH in a good way if you know what I mean)!  Tori not only gave me a really deep massage and got deep into every area that needed it, but she also stretched me out - like really stretched me out to the point that I felt loose, limber, and and so much more flexible when I walked out.I won't hesitate to go see Tori again... but I'm hoping that all of you reading this don't book up her schedule.

As a matter of fact, most people that see me, a first time mom, in action, are telling me I seem pretty calm.  I have to credit this calmness to Desiree Nessline of Arizona Baby Services.Thankfully, I met Desiree through another first time mom (thanks Lori M) and planned ahead (aka booked her services months in advance), so that Desiree was able to spend our first 48 hours at home with us and the baby.  Desiree is not only a night nurse.  She's a newborn specialist and her services include:*nighttime care *infant sleep training*infant sleep consulting*infant care consulting*correction of ""poor sleep habits""*reflux/colic relief*around the clock infant care (24/7)*preemie care*multiples care*preparing baby's nursery*short term night nanny*short term day nanny*traveling duty   Basically, Desiree is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to anything and everything baby-related.  She helped me with preparing for the baby, the essentials I needed for the nursery, getting the baby on a sleep schedule, breast-feeding, pumping, swaddling, diaper changing, and so much more!  Even after the time that Desiree spent with us, she's made herself available to answer questions of all sorts... I am sure I will continue to use Desiree's services in the future as needed and I highly recommend her to anyone looking for help whether you're a first-time mom or if you have experience already.

Once was just for a tour when I was involved with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation years ago.  I was super impressed with what I learned and saw during that visit and I became a fan back then even before I had children of my own.The next two visits were more recent emergency visits with my son... One for Croup and the other for a night terror (of course I didn't know either diagnosis until after the fact).  Both times the lines to get in to see a doctor were rather long.

We found them all to be patient as well, which is tough when you know they are constantly dealing with sick or injured children.PCH has a reputation for being the best in Arizona for a reason... the name speaks for itself.From the colorful curtains in each room to the movies playing on TVs throughout the lobbies and individual rooms, toys for children to play with as they wait to be seen, etc... They even offered my son stickers as we were leaving.  I am a fan of this place and I like knowing that it's nearby.  That being said, I hope that I won't have to visit PCH again ever.

Well, I really like the easy scheduling, almost non-exsistent wait time (both in the lobby and for making appts) and my doctor, Dr Gregory De Santo.  This location (32nd St) is the 2nd location I have visited and actually, is the closer to my house.  Dr De Santo works between both offices, with Tue and Thur being at this one, I believe.  It's much the same here and has the same set-up and benefits as the other (ultrasound machines, lab in office, etc).  I went to the Scottsdale location for so long but think I'll finish out my pregnancy here.  It's just closer to my house... oh and it has no stairs. hahaHere's my review on the other location.. just thought I'd paste it because I'm lazy to rewrite everything...Now that I've had a couple of visits to Camelback Women's Health, a review is appropriate.  After finding them on an internet search for prenatal services, I called and spoke to a couple of women.  After answering many of my questions over a few calls, I was ready to make an appt.  ask me what my choice of Dr was and I simply ask them to set me up with the one they preferred... enter, Dr. Gregory DeSanto.I was always told that picking your maternity doctor was quite the chore.  It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  * There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.See ya there!",3,aJ64ACon5V-1JywdaZ2Uzg,2,soJZKewVj1wHvsB87LultQ,3/4/2011,5,1,33,"4530 N 32nd St, Ste 100","{'AcceptsInsurance': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': True, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True}","['Doctors', 'Obstetricians & Gynecologists', 'Fertility', 'Health & Medical']",Phoenix,"{'Friday': '8:00-17:00', 'Tuesday': '8:00-17:00', 'Thursday': '8:00-17:00', 'Wednesday': '8:00-17:00', 'Monday': '8:00-17:00'}",1,33.503758,-112.0132842,Camelback Womens Health,,85018,52,3,AZ,Health & Medical,Arizona,Susan

While the black hair guy at front was very nice and the newbie video was funny, laying in an egg of salt water for an hour is apparently not my cup of tea.  I didn't even make it through the hour before I had to get out.  The first 30 min were cool... I drifted off into a tranquil state but then I heard a 'thump' from somewhere that woke me up and I couldn't get back to tranquility.  There were other glitches, too.  My joints literally creaked... snap, crackle, pop, for days afterwards.  And, they had ear plugs that I didn't use (they were optional according to the initial tour), and now, my ears have been 'squeaky' for 6 days.  Every time I yawn, burp or do any kind of weird jaw movement, I can feel it in my ears.  :-/ Weird.  When I went in the next day to ask about the feeling in my ears, a light haired guy behind the counter said he didn't know what to do for it because he floats with no buds all the time and everybody must just be different.  Oh, ok.  Thanks.  So... while it may work for some, it may not be for everyone.  Other thoughts... wow, it's kinda pricey.  If you're not a member, it's $70 a float.  My friend gifted the experience to me but if I'd have paid $70, I'd have been pretty disappointed.

I had spoken to a friend on the phone on my way to the ER and was told that SHS is a very good hospital with quality doctors (friend recruits doctors), but after speaking with sis and her husband, who advised me to go to an Urgent Care instead, I decided to leave this ER, especially when I heard it was a teaching hospital.  I told the admissions officer I was leaving, and as I walked away, I texted my doctor-recruiting friend that I was heading to a UC facility.  He called me immediately and advised me to go back to the ER as a.) I was already there; and b.) even if it's a teaching facility, this ER will have quality doctors shadowing interns; and c.) ERs are better-equipped at repairing head lacerations than UCs.  So I returned to the lobby and to my seat, dismayed at the number of other patients that had arrived, but it was probably five minutes later that the triage nurse called out my name so that she may take me in and input my vitals.  This nurse never greeted me hello, how are you, and never replied back when I said thank you (at least three times).  She was very curt and efficient, as I imagine triage nurses would have to be since ERs could get very hectic, but a little warmth would've been nice.Nurse Laura was much-friendlier and smiling the whole time, and also was nice to talk to.  I met Cory, who I first thought was another nurse, but now think perhaps he is a resident intern.  Laura took more vitals before and after, and explained what were going to happen (cleaning of the wound by Cory, numbing injection and stapling by ER doctor, and paperwork involved so that I may leave after) while I was there, and also instructions for cleaning and maintenance of the staples before getting them removed ten days later.  After Corey washed the site with hydrogen peroxide, the ER doc Norquist came in, introduced himself with a handshake (that's nice), introduced another woman who was there to record my answers to his questions (what happened, when, and how), and then proceeded to explain what he was going to do.  He advised that the two shots of numbing solution will hurt (syringe puncture and burning sensation of painkiller), but all I felt was a cool sensation spreading over the painful area.  Funny that my blood pressure was normal when I came in (90 systolic), but was at 115 systolic after the procedure-- I think Dr. Norquist's warnings made me very nervous, as well as the sound and feel of five staples being applied on my scalp!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scottsdale-healthcare-shea-scottsdale-5#6oYPYy5h-TsdDF6ce1_Z0gMy experience at this ER was fast and overall pleasant, with the exception of the stoic triage nurse.  I wished it didn't take so long for me to be able to leave (exit papers and payment), but perhaps it was time well-spent to decompress from everything that had happened that morning; a good time for my blood pressure to fall back to normal before driving home.  I hope I, or other beloveds, will not have any reason to go to an ER, but if we do, it's nice to know I may depend on Scottsdale Healthcare Shea and its staff for efficiency and overall friendly care while here.",27,rkRYZq3ztIc1IEJ_FzpZsg,22,sppgg_4QXgy218qj7NJj-Q,4/11/2015,3,15,32,9003 E Shea Blvd,"{'AcceptsInsurance': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True}","['Doctors', 'Health & Medical', 'Hospitals', 'Emergency Rooms']",Scottsdale,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,33.580069,-111.8851432,HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center,,85260,149,3.5,AZ,Health & Medical,Arizona,Aileen

I was told to wait an hour before eating anything to allow the temporary filling to set.  Oh yes, I, who could not even think of eating anything on Turkey Day, was enjoying a delicious tom kha gai, chicken red curry with jasmine rice, and a Thai iced tea 90 minutes after having undergoing my first root canal :)Thank you, Dr. Asrari and Shadolyn, for making the process relatively painless and stress-free!

We rarely go beyond an hour w/ every dental service, except for the time I had a crown attached.  (Silly thing wouldn't fit...)

The second time was when reparations at SWIHA caused them to close shop and move all appointments (including my massage) here.  I was not able to enjoy the massage as much, bec. the open ceilings allowed all sorts of noises (conversations, construction noises coming from next door, etc.) in- too distracting.I was able to experience my first mud wrap after first reading about SWINA's offering back in June '08 last Friday.  I'd have to say it was nothing I thought it would be.  I thought I'd be lying in a bed of mud (like I've seen in European travel logs) w/ some slices of fruit or veggies covering my eyes (no, not cucumber slices... I'm allergic to cukes!).  Nope.  No mud bed.  No sliced garnishes placed on the windows of my soul.  However, I did get two women to simultaneously massage my back (Cassie) and leg muscles (Patty)!!  Woah!  So this is what tandem massages are all about!!  I asked if this was standard practice here in SWINA, 'cause if it is, I could definitely get used to this!  But no, I'm told that I got lucky that day, w/ students' schedules opening up at just the right moment to allow me this extra luxury.  (If you ask me, I think it's a ploy to get newbies to come back for treatments week after week!)But let's backtrack a bit and start in the beginning.  After stripping down to my comfort level (topless), and lying face down on the massage table (I requested a face pillow for more comfort), Cassie and Patty proceeded to give me the back and leg massages.  Afterwards, they employed natural brushes over exposed areas for an all-over exfoliation.  The sensations ranged from slightly ticklish to soothing (you may tailor the pressure exerted).  I was asked to flip over onto my back, and soon after, the mud was then painted on by both women with another set of brushes.  This was when the treatment started to go downhill for me... the mud was applied cold, and thank goodness there was a heat lamp nearby to keep me warm.  After painting my back, arms, legs, and abs, the two women proceeded to wrap plastic around my extremities and then again w/ another wrap that was already laid on top of the massage table under me.  (If you suffer from claustrophobia, body wraps are not for you!)  Patty then left Cassie to help another student.  Cassie then proceeded to give me my second favorite part of the treatment, which is a head and neck massage.  Nice!!  After, Cassie offered to give me something complimentary- a facial massage!  Would I want one?  Why, yes, thank you very much!  After all that pampering, we were now at the point where I again had to endure chills while Cassie wiped off the mud w/ warm towels.  But I requested hotter towels, as in steaming hot!, and poor Cassie... her hands were burning!, but she did what I requested, and I was able to stave off the chills for awhile.  To ""wrap"" things up, Cassie followed up w/ a hypoallergenic Lotus Touch lotion.  My skin felt supple, but nothing different than what I'd experience after a bath at home using Aveda Soothing Therapy salts.  On the whole, the experience was good, but most of it is bec. of Cassie's bedside manner.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask for her again.  However, I don't think I'd try another wrap- SWINA offers three: mud, seaweed, and herbal- since I'd rather not get chilled, plus the plastic wraps used aren't biodegradeable, so I'd feel guilty causing all that pollution!

I've been a patient of Dr. Madonna Mallari, one of the internists here, since 2013.  I've also seen two other internists when she wasn't available, and Drs. Atienza and Wong were just as warm, friendly, efficient, and accessible as she is.  The reception staff are also nice and upbeat.  My first visit with Dr. Mallari was for a wellness/physical, a yearly check-up I always find stressful for it includes a Pap test, and I knew that Mallari was going to be my new doctor when the Pap test ended just a few seconds after it began and, more importantly, was PAINLESS!  This annual procedure always seemed to last for longer than ten minutes and necessitated the use of super-cold metal instruments that caused much anxiety and pain, but with Mallari, I barely felt a pinch!  I actually said ""That's it?""  I went home and told Mom I found a doctor for us, so she promptly made an appointment to see her, too.After that initial appointment, I found it hard to schedule the next few visits with Mallari (either she was on vacation, or working at another location) and I've had to settle for Urgent Care when I came down with colds and sinus infections and an appointment with Dr. Atienza, who did my second physical and proposed booster shots (flu and tetanus-- don't believe when you're told you will be sore for only a few days... I was sore for almost three weeks!).  Atienza also informed me that if my past Pap tests have been normal, then I won't have to take it every year- whew!  Dr. Wong was the doctor that removed the staples on my head that I acquired after a fainting spell that left me with a 1.5 inch parietal gash, which an emergency doctor at the Shea Hospital next door stapled shut ten days before.  Wong was affable and easy-going, as if we've known each other for a long time.  When I tried to schedule an appointment to see Mallari, but couldn't get an earlier date and time, I tried to ask for Wong, or even Atienza, but was told that if Mallari was scheduled to work at the Shea clinic, then I will have to wait for an appointment with her.  For that, I'd only rate 3.5 stars out of five.  The other star is for the in-house lab for blood work and other lab tests, which I always have to get done, thanks to my fainting spells, viitamin D deficiency, and other traits I have been blessed with.  No more trekking to other labs, often far from home, with orders in hand.  Just show up a little earlier before your doctor's appointment, or hang out after and get them done here.  The phlebotomists are efficient and skilled at what they do, and if one isn't sure he, or she will be able to get it right the first time (my veins can get very shy, especially when it's chilly outdoors, or indoors, and it almost always is chilly inside clinics), then the initial phlebotomist will ask the other one to step in, which is what happened this morning.  Kudos to the woman who studied both of my arms for the better vein, instead of puncturing me at both arms and feet, without success, like those phlebotomy students did at the Mayo Clinic a few years ago!  I hope that I'm able to find a home nearby to move into, so I won't have to search for another medical group!",55,BPGoy8p97C1N5ndD-c-H7Q,53,A4IPBr9pb5FHTT0too2jRQ,2/4/2016,5,35,14,"10301 N 92nd St, Ste B-201","{'AcceptsInsurance': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': True, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True}","['Doctors', 'Hospitals', 'Health & Medical']",Scottsdale,"{'Friday': '8:00-17:00', 'Tuesday': '8:00-17:00', 'Thursday': '8:00-17:00', 'Wednesday': '8:00-17:00', 'Monday': '8:00-17:00'}",1,33.5795398,-111.8812636,HonorHealth Medical Group - Shea,,85258,8,3,AZ,Health & Medical,Arizona,Aileen

I bought two certificates thinking I'd gift them to my Mom.  She ended up not wanting to use them, so I decided to try the treatments myself.  VelaShape laser treatments are supposed to be most effective when one goes for the full five-treatment process, but I thought I'd try two treatments and see how they go.I didn't care for the representatives at the desk that checked me in, esp. the blonde, straight-haired woman who wouldn't make eye contact (on ALL my visits)-- I also had the misfortune of hearing her complain on her cellphone w/ a merchant about a charge made on her credit card that first visit, while I was waiting for someone to greet me at the desk.  Michael, who did the treatments on me, was very personable.  When he saw the area I wanted work done, he asked what I wanted to do, and I said to get rid of the flab in my ab area.  He said something to the effect that I didn't have much to get rid of, and then proceeded w/ the treatment.  The two-part process included a tool that applied a lot of heat in short bursts that would end w/ one that was almost too painful to endure, and then he'd move to another area- most of the bursts would feel like hot pinches.  I ended up doing a total of three treatments (paying another $99 for the third), had burn marks from the last two, and still did not see any improvements.Michael mentioned how I won't see much reduction since I'm smaller than the average patient he sees at the clinic- that larger patients see results faster (??), and that full benefits won't be seen until after four of five treatments.  My reply to those statements were that since I didn't have much to get rid of, shouldn't it take less than five treatments then to see any results?  So please learn from my vain attempts to keep aging and laziness from taking over my body and stay away from expensive VelaShape laser treatments that do not work.  (These treatments were offered at 75% off.)  I could've stayed mum and not have you know about my foolishness (""a fool and his money are soon parted"" definitely applies here, doesn't it?), but I'd rather admit to it and cry in shame in hopes to help a few of you decide against trying this treatment!  Use your money instead and enroll in a gym, or buy a few exercise DVDs and exercise in the comfort of your own living room![I've gone back to running on the treadmill again, after my broken toe healed, so I'm losing the flab slowly, but surely.  :)]",23,c6HI-wuV5gAfE6HJKJR8UQ,13,fORGcQMYB94qOHEkIOBZPw,6/5/2011,1,15,13,"4045 E Bell Rd, Ste 157","{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'WheelchairAccessible': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Laser Hair Removal', 'Health & Medical', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Doctors', 'Hair Removal', 'Dermatologists']",Phoenix,"{'Friday': '9:00-17:00', 'Tuesday': '9:00-17:00', 'Thursday': '9:00-17:00', 'Wednesday': '9:00-17:00', 'Monday': '9:00-17:00'}",0,33.6399126,-111.9947437,Physician Laser Centers,,85032,22,2.5,AZ,Health & Medical,Arizona,Aileen

So, whenever I'm back in the Midwest, I try to stop by a Meijer to relive the magic. Of course, it's just a grocery store and the magic of yesteryear has somewhat abandoned me, but they still put together a fine assortment of goods. The produce section, for example, is above average.

I guess that's what I get for Waking Up In Vegas...As you can imagine, my debauchery from the previous night left me severely hungover so after getting a bite to eat at Grand Lux Cafxc3xa9, my friend suggested that we all go to Canyon Ranch Spa Club for some ""Steam Therapy"".  On Saturday, 2.19.11, we (party of six) came to CRSC at around 1 PM. There are two employees at the front desk. It took about 10 minutes to check-in and pay. There's a women, men and co-ed section in the spa. We stayed at the women's only section. FEE$40/day pass to use the gym and spa facilities. HOWEVER, it's only $20/person if your hotel room (Palazzo or The Venetian) is charged with a resort fee. If it's not, I highly recommend you paying the $17.95 one-time resort fee at the spa because it will cover everyone in your party. My friend paid the resort fee, so we ended up saving about $17/person. LOCKER ROOMYou will be provided a magnet key wristlet to access your locker. Your robe will be provided in your locker. TIP: BRING YOUR OWN SLIPPERS/FLIP FLOPS! TRUST ME!The pressure point slippers that's provided are the most UNCOMFOTABLE slippers ever! With each step, it felt like I was walking on pebble stone pavement. EVERYONE was complaining about how painful they were and that we were better off wearing out 5-inch stilettos from the previous night...no joke! I hated those slippers so much, I wanted to BURN mine after leaving!AQUAVANA THERMAL ENVIRONMENTSVarious aquathermal environments that are designed to help with muscle relaxation, increase oxygen flow and most importantly RID YOUR BODY OF TOXINS! The perfect ""morning after"" remedy after a night of copious drinking!ROOM #1: IGLOOExactly as the name says, it's basically a big freezer. My least favorite of all the rooms because of the cold temperature. ROOM #2: JACUZZ WITH HEATED LOUNGERSThe jacuzzi (bathing suit optional) could accommodate about 8-10 people. I LOVED the heated loungers (there were 6). They were made of some type of Styrofoam material that was firm yet soft. The loungers were so warm and comforting that I could have slept on it the whole day.ROOM #3: HERBAL  LACONIUM (WET STEAM ROOM) - HANGOVER CURE!!!!!If you're not use to humid heat, the Herbal Laconium room may be too much to handle in the beginning. HOWEVER, after several minutes, your body will adjust to the heat and it will become very bearable.  As I closed my eyes, breathed in deeply and exhaled, I could feel my body releasing all the tequila and goose through my pores and my pounding headache becoming fainter and fainter.  TIP: Drink plenty of water beforehand and pick up an iced towel (to cover your face) in the Jacuzzi room which will make it much easier to breathe in the steam room.  ROOM #4: Finnish Sauna (Dry Heat Room)Not a fan of dry heat rooms as I feel like I'm stuck in a charcoal bbq minus the charcoal. ROOM #5: Crystal Steam Room (Aromatherapy Steam Room)Saving the best for last! The aromatherapy steam room is less intense than the Herbal Laconium room and the fragrant floral scents will enhance your mood. THE QUIET ROOM/LOUNGEEnd your Aquavana Session at the quiet room where you can lay on plushy oversized sofas while reading trashy magazines and munching on fresh apples, bananas and oranges. It was so quiet and serene that I ended up taking a 10-minute power nap. I woke up refreshed with my pounding headache all gone!SHOWER/MAKEUP ROOM*10-15 private showers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash in each one*Personal sink area with lotions, deodorant, hair care products, hair dryer, combs, brushes, etc*If you need a curling iron or flat iron, you can get it at the front deskTIP: If you need a razer, shower cap, and/or towels, make sure to grab them before getting into the shower room. They're located near the entrance way to the showers.OVERALL LAYOUTThe CRSC is BIG and I didn't even know how big until I got lost and ended up on the men's side. It's confusing to say the least and it was like a maze to get out. If you suffer from ""Waking Up In Vegas"" syndrome like I always seem to, I highly recommend coming to the CRSC to get you out of your funk!",12,eWKZyDPXdkhrT8v8XD2OrQ,3,dPXJNnBIYeIETYy01Euvbg,2/28/2011,3,7,23,"3355 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste 1159","{'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'BikeParking': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Hair Salons', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Gyms', 'Active Life', 'Health & Medical', 'Nutritionists', 'Day Spas', 'Fitness & Instruction']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '6:00-20:00', 'Tuesday': '6:00-20:00', 'Friday': '6:00-20:00', 'Wednesday': '6:00-20:00', 'Thursday': '6:00-20:00', 'Sunday': '6:00-20:00', 'Saturday': '6:00-20:00'}",1,36.1226902,-115.1701939,Canyon Ranch SpaClub - Las Vegas,The Strip,89109,465,3.5,NV,Health & Medical,Nevada,Cherylynn

Several friends raved about the experience with such remarks as ""opening up the Google search of your brain"" to ""feeling like the 1 hour mark after 'shroom tea"" to ""mentally going to Mars"".  Their levels of sobriety ranged from stone cold to having smoked an ounce in the parking lot.  I was somewhere in between.      The friendly attendant, John, clearly explained what to do and how to operate the pod.  Being a first timer, I also watched a 6 minute video on how to maximize my float time which offered some helpful suggestions (body position, breathing) while glazing over some new age, self improvement stuff.  John also informed me to hang in their relaxation room upon finishing since many feel disoriented and extremely euphoric afterwards.  Uhhh..what??  So I get out of the shower, put the ear plugs in, get in the pod.....""And I'm floating in a most peculiar way""I initially found the whole thing a bit comical.  Here I am...naked, in a dark and confined space, lying in 93.5 degree water...isn't this a torture method in Guantanamo Bay?  But after I got over the initial weirdness, things got interesting....   ""And the stars look very different today""It definitely felt like drifting in outer space.  My mind darted through a billion thoughts before I was able to end up in a kind of neutral, semi-conscious, relaxed zone.

After being sick of contacts and glasses for 15+ years, she finally wanted to get it done.After some research and speaking with a few facilities, it seemed like the best choice was either here or Lasik of Nevada.  We chose Siems based on our talk with the consultant, price for the exact same treatment and also their proximity to our home.  My wife didn't want to schlep it all the way to Henderson for follow ups.  Dr. Siems made us feel comfortable right away upon the first meeting.  His office is very nice.  The lobby feels spa-like.  Needless to say we were nervous when the big day finally came for her to get the procedure done.  You hear that there's a high 90% success rate but a person only has one pair of eyes.  Dr. Siems and his staff made my wife as comfortable as possible (valium helped).  I was able to view the whole procedure on a television outside of the operating room and it definitely made me wince a little when they cut the lens and started shooting the lasers in her eyes. The whole procedure took less than 30 minutes.  She then took another valium and slept for about 18 hours.  She was able to see very clearly the next day and it just improved from there.  Post operation checkups are included in the price so the day after, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year were all taken care of.  Now that it has been well over a year, she says it's one of the best things she's ever done in life.  I've worn glasses more than half of my life and feel like the fat guy at Mr Olympia or the dude with no tattoos in a tattoo parlor when I go in there.  They always ask me when I am going to do it.

Thank you Yelp for sending me their way!Belly Bliss is a combination of things - a boutique store for mamas-to-be (and future dads), a spa, and offers classes and groups that are related to pregnancy and babies.Recently, I went specifically to experience their spa services.  Taking advantage of their seasonal specials, I got the Joyful Package for $170.  It consisted of a 60 minute ""Girls Getaway"" massage and a 90 minute signature ""Body in Balance"" facial treatment.  Joann M. was my massage therapist and Margo S. was my aesthetician.  Because this place specializes in working with pregnant woman, they make every attempt to make sure that you are comfortable during all your treatments.  Tables easily adjust for the head and body and plenty of pillows and supports are available for your comfort.  Both were professional and friendly and you get the feeling they both really enjoy working with all their pregnant clients. (Margo told me to come back again and bring the baby!)  Sure, there are plenty of spas in town that offer prenatal massage, but you end up paying an upcharge to use their facilities.  When in actuality, most pregnant women are discouraged from using the jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc.  So you end up feeling a bit short changed when all you wanted was some personal body work done.  Belly Bliss gives you just that without all the frills.  They only have a few treatments rooms available, so it shouldn't be crowded when you go.Once your treatment is done, you can help yourself to their little snack bar where you can fill a take out box full of pretzels, goldfish crackers, lollipops, and raisins.  Plenty of spa water and apples are available too.Getting treatments done on Tuesdays also gives you 10% off your spa services!  Sweet!  Apparently, free eyebrow waxes and foot massages are available on Tuesdays as well.  Call ahead to confirm and make reservations! You can't help but take a look through their store on your way out.  So many cool and useful items are available for you to check out and purchase.  It can be a bit dangerous actually!Belly Bliss is located on the 2nd floor of the Desert Perinatal Associates office, so doctors are only a few steps away if you're really concerned about anything.Classes include Breastfeeding, Yoga (Pre and Postnatal), Newborn Care and Immunization, Baby Massage, How to Select a Childcare Facility, and Childbirth Education.  Medela breast pumps are available for rental too! They also have party rental space if you want to plan a baby shower or private party at their facility.Gift certificates are available and any pregnant girl would be happy to receive a service from Belly Bliss!  Husbands, boyfriends, fathers, partners, friends - check this place out and give a great gift for a future mama!

(What's even sweeter, you can buy 5 gift cards and get 1 free here!! Score!)Bali Foot Spa is yet another place that has popped up in Vegas and smack dab in the oh so popular area of Spring Mountain.  This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.Walking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)Walking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)

Where does one begin with the plethora of foot massage places along Spring Mountain? I took a chance and called The Foot Spa. I inquired if they had 2 females available in five minutes and they said yes. After explaining our options between the Basic ($20/hr) or Deep Tissue ($30/hr), and Yelp 'specials', we settled on the Basic. (Basic is more footwork whereas Deep Tissue is more back work.)We were led into the main room that has about 7 massage beds. I went to the restroom first and noticed they were out of soap. I took the time to open the dispenser in hopes that they 'just' ran out. Nope. Nothing in there. I even checked under the sink and found 3 more empty soap bottles! I was desperate and added some water and shook it just to get something soapy to wash my hands with. I reported back to the Husband with my discovery and was surprised he didn't suggest leaving. Buckets of hot water arrived for our feet to soak and I've noticed only 1 female employee is available. (This is exactly why I call ahead.) They offer us tea or water while we soaked. They left us soaking for about 10 minutes. (I hope they don't count this as part of our hour and luckily, they didn't! It's happened to us before!) Another female arrives and they both get to work. I had LINDA and the Husband had BELLA. Linda was great! I made the mistake of declining a private single room when she offered it and now I know why. It was a pretty cramped area for her to work around as I was seated against the wall. She had to make the long trek around the other chairs to move from my head to my feet since there was  a table blocking her pathway. So that was my mistake. She did some pretty great scalp work, which I definitely appreciate it. She also does some stretching. But my favorite was her back work. She does more of a back rolling pressure massage which is what I needed, but then she kneeled on my back and put all her weight in. Mind blown! It was pretty freakin' awesome. When the Husband's massage girl tried talking to mine, she shushed her. Gotta love that! (The Husband says I usually get the chatty ones, which I detest.) When my massage was done, I told the Husband that I was leaving a bigger tip. He agreed that he would be too! He was similarly impressed with Bella's back work as well. For the Basic service, I was quite pleased. It's pretty rare when we both are equally impressed with our massage people.At the beginning of my session, the front desk guy comes by to let me know that if I need anything, to let Linda know. I take this opportunity to tell him there's no more soap in the restroom.  He didn't understand and so I repeated myself. He seemed to understand and said he would take care of it right away. So, of course at the end of my session, I just had to check to see if they got soap. Nope! C'mon! I gave the guy over an hour to buy some soap and it didn't happen! When we went to pay, I told him again there was no soap in the restroom. Again, he didn't understand and I repeated myself. Then it seemed like he understood and relayed something to Linda. Ultimately, no business should ever run out of soap! They do accept credit cards, but there's a 50 cent charge. It's posted, but it would have been nice to be told this since the Husband only realized it when he signed the credit card slip. The guy did give us back our 50 cents though. 5 stars for Linda and Bella but 2 stars for the facilities and no soap! Buy some soap and remove a massage bed so it's not so cramped. 3.5 stars overallThey offer a frequent visitor card - Get 10 foot massages and get 1 free.",6,3_QNAH8yVzY0sBPftWyNhQ,3,-4F4oh1gEUF3-5BG8OuHwA,9/28/2015,4,3,35,"5030 Spring Mountain Rd, Ste 10","{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'BikeParking': True, 'AcceptsInsurance': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Day Spas', 'Massage', 'Massage Therapy', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Health & Medical']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '11:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Friday': '11:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '11:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '11:00-0:00'}",1,36.1270336,-115.2096821,The Foot Spa,Chinatown,89146,694,4,NV,Health & Medical,Nevada,Teri

But since the Baby was born, it was time to go back to getting some serious work done and Best Foot Spa was calling!First off, I chose this place because it was blowing up on Yelp at the time and second of all, the famous Rex opened this place up.  So, I had to go where he was and experience his magical hand, right?It was my mom and I on this experience and we made appointments just in case.  We were led into a semi-private space with two chairs.  Rex worked on me while my mom had Lee.  As with all of good foot massage places, your feet start off in a hot bath while they work on you head, neck and shoulders.  Then they eventually move onto your feet and then have you sit up to work on your shoulders before having you flip over and lie down!  Yep, lie down I tell you!  I love it when they tell me to flip over and lie down!  (Not all Vegas foot massage places offer this ""flip over"" business!)  That's when they get to working on your back and pushing you this way and that way while your face is in this hole.  This is what I was looking for!One of the cool things they have are hooks for your purse and jackets - nice touch.  It's the little things that matter!I definitely appreciated that Rex makes a point of looking at the clock when he starts and telling you what time it is so there's no confusion about that.  (Unlike a few other places that claim you're getting a 60 minute treatment, but it's really 50.)At the end of our service, Rex assures me that it's always the same people working there - himself, Lee, Elaine (or Eileen) and Carol.  I think this is because there are so many places that contract workers here and there.  So that makes me feel that you are certain of getting a specific kind of experience there.They also offer a Yelp discount too! 4.5 stars.* Update! (09.20.11)Going down to a 4 star rating.  Lee worked on me last night and although he was good, the smell of cigarette smoke is very distracting.  I hate to have to ask ahead of time if the person working on me is a smoker or not, but I have a strong sense of smell!  That put me off from the very beginning.  Also, Rex took a call while he was working on the Husband.  Yes, I know it's business and all, but very distracting and a big pet peeve of ours.  Get someone else to handle the phones please. Right before they started working on our feet, they mentioned that they could make my feet like a baby's butt...for an additional 30 minutes and a $29 charge.  It includes a hot wax...which I assume is a parafin wax dip.

We always welcome a little healthy competition, even if Vegas does seem a bit over saturated with foot massage places.  We aren't always so anxious to make the drive to Spring Mountain to get some foot work done.The Husband noticed the sign driving on S. Rainbow and with only two yelp reviews, we were a bit hesitant.  We called ahead to find out the prices and to see if there was any availability.  They normally charge $38/hr, but with the Yelp discount - it's $34.  (They are currently offering a Yelp Deal too - $15 for $20 towards service, which I doubt you can combine.)We didn't make an appointment but were the only ones there last night.  Angel warmly greeted us and had us take a seat amongst the handful of chairs in the main room.  As she went to get us our tea, she hastily made a few calls getting her employees in as they had gone on an errand.  She told us about her business, gave us some information on Pure Foot & Spa and reflexology, and asked us what we thought of the interior decorating.  She had our feet soaking in the hot water while we waited, so we didn't mind.  It wasn't too long when one of the ladies returned.  She immediately got started on the Husband, so Angel started working on me while I waited for my guy to return.  As her delicate hands started working on my face, I was almost hoping my guy didn't return.  (There are some people that have gentle hands, and she's one of them.)  After a few minutes, my guy did arrive and he got started on me.Everything was pretty straightforward from them on - they work on your head, neck, and shoulders before heading to your feet and calves.  And after wiping down your feet, they flip you over so you get some back work.  One thing I really appreciate here is that they actually spend a good amount of time on your feet and calves.  Sometimes other places focus more on shoulders, but my feet and calves were what needed the attention and they got it.  Usually, I can tell the Husband is having a good experience when I hear him snoring.  This time, I didn't hear him snore at all, so I was concerned.  I was pleasantly surprised when he asked the name of his lady though because he obviously wanted to remember who she was.  Overall, we were both quite happy with our experience at Pure Foot and definitely glad to have them in the neighborhood.

(Of course, this is not to be confused with the service also known as body shampoos found at places with questionable intentions.)When inquiring about this service, we were led passed the chairs reserved for foot massages and into the back room.  This room had three massage beds with sinks specifically built attached to them.  The Husband and I then had our shoulders covered with a towel and plastic to prevent those areas from getting wet and we laid down with our heads over the sink.  This is where the similarities ended.The person I had was Mark.  I have long hair.  He started to massage my scalp for a little while before turning the water on to wet my hair.  He then shampooed my hair and spent a considerable amount of time 'scratching' my scalp.  This is something that can be enjoyable and quite relaxing depending on the person and the circumstance, but it was just okay this time.  He then also did some cranial pressure before rinsing my hair of the shampoo and applying conditioner.  He made a point of making sure my hair was completely conditioned as he ran a comb through it all.  And then he rinsed all the conditioner out and squeezed some of the water out of my hair.  I was then instructed to get up so we could walk to a smaller room where he would blow dry my hair.  He then dried my hair and ran a brush through it to get rid of any tangles.  And then I was done.  Unfortunately, my hair was still a bit damp and the bottom half of my shirt in the back was all wet from the walk from the sink to the blow drying room.  (Perhaps he could have wrapped my hair in a towel to prevent that from happening.)  He apologized for the wet shirt part but I had to go blow dry my shirt as a result.  3 stars.Meanwhile, the Husband has practically no hair and he had Reao.  He said he didn't get that much scratching, but more pressure on his scalp, face, and shoulders.  While I was getting my hair blow dried, he was still getting cranial work done.  He felt so relaxed that he almost fell asleep.  He tried to inquire about what other services would take place if we had chosen the 60 minute option, but Reao did not quite understand him.  She thought he was trying to extend his experience to the 60 minute one.  He wanted to know if they were going to focus more on the scalp, shoulders, or face.  He really enjoyed it and would do it again.  4.5 stars from him.I think I lost out on the experience because: a) I had a guy.  (And unfortunately I believe he smelled of cigarette smoke.  So with my sensitive sense of smell, and him running his hands through my hair, it was distracting.)  b) I have long hair.  Because so much time was spent shampooing, conditioning, and blow drying, there was less time for cranial work. Yes, I know it's called a head shampoo but you know you're really there for good cranial work.  It's almost like a glorified hair shampooing experience at your local salon.  Overall, I think if you're a bald guy, you may just love it.  Half the experience at a hair salon is getting your head shampooed and massaged and this place focuses on that part.  Unfortunately, I just didn't get that many head tingles from the experience like I was hoping for!  Would I go back?  Maybe - if I cut my hair and/or if I get a girl next time.  Some girls just know how to massage the scalp better, maybe it's the nail thing? 30 minutes = $2560 minutes = $4860 minutes combo = $45 (30 minute head shampoo and 30 minute reflexology)They are located exactly next door to Ichiza.

So when my family went to Vegas to celebrate my brother and sister's birthdays, I knew we'd spend some time at the spa.  Even more exciting was that since we were staying at the Venetian, we were able to indulge at the Canyon Ranch Spa facility there... I admit, I'm spoiled.  I've been to Canyon Ranch in Tucson a handful of times and I really do consider it heaven on earth!  So there isn't much that would live up to the Tucson location, but the SpaClub at the Venetian comes close.  I worked out a couple of the days in their facility and even took a couple of classes - a body strength and a 'fit tease' - both were decent workouts and fun too!  Now that the workout is covered, on to the pampering... My mom, sister, and I all planned ahead and we each had a massage on one day and a facial the next.  Mom and Aubs had the signature Canyon Ranch massage and I decided to change it up and went with the Thai Yoga massage - all were phenomenal!  We were all invigorated after our services and we were each given a 'healthy living card' from our therapists on our way out... what a nice touch!

I feared that my son would ask me to dress like Herman Munster or a Walking Dead character, neither which would be far-fetched if you knew me.

A cool feature they offer is the live streaming with sound so that others who couldn't make the happy event were able to witness the ceremony.Some other highlights: [1] The staff was very relaxed about letting us knock back champagne while leaning against the limousine.

I, as customary, kept my thoughts to myself, but was tempted to ask the quiet woman if she really wanted to marry such a loud,  rude woman.

They were however at least kept to the family - it is not like I am picking up people off the street and taking them to the emergency room, at Mercy or elsewhere.On this visit, I had to get some lab work.  Now I was never a fan of labs.  The mad scientist lab on Movie Macabre, perhaps.  But the type of lab you would have to do in biology?  I was too busy creating (and yes, throwing) spitballs across the room.  Still not the right kind of lab, yet I hope you get the idea how I am not a fan.The visit starts with the parking.  Mercy has never been strong here - they excel in friendliness, not in convenience.  For the emergency room, you get a nice - almost cozy - parking lot.  For the main entrance, parking is decent, but not particularly close.  Luckily, I scored a ride from some guy in a golf cart.  I am lucky that he did not seem to be a fan of Movie Macabre.  At least, if he is, he was working, and did not have time to 'cart' me to the woods.  Had he done so, I was at least close by - and how far can a golf cart really get before it dies from lack of juice?Once inside, the main entrance has been redone.  Completely.  It is really quite impressive.  Unfortunately, they have to pay for all of that, and what should be a really simple process of sticking you becomes a rather tedious check-in (including a wristband), a journey to another floor, and waiting, waiting and waiting some more.Finally I give just two tiny vials of blood and get to leave, without so much as the courtesy of a reach around (or even a ride back to the car via the golf cart).

Unlike fast food, where you will probably be okay if you get a sub-par burger, you may want to do your best to make sure you get a good one when it comes to your teeth.Unfortunately there is no really good system.  Most of us look for a decent office, find a solid web page, depend on suggestions from our insurance carrier or ask our friends for ideas.  We might even ask people on the web!  And then we pull into the most convenient place anyway because we have put it off for so long we really have little other choice - and then generally pull out unhappy.  Heh.  I said ""pull out"".So when we relocated to Mint Hill, we were naturally inundated with flyers from just about every dentist in the area.  Which is to say, three of them.

The receptionist is very sweet, even offering to check into our insurance before we even arrive (of course, that helps them as much as it does us), and the waiting room is incredibly welcoming, and especially so for a dentist.Office hours are great - they are closed on Mondays, but they make up for it by being open later on other days and even on Saturdays!  The actual work rooms are almost as nice as the waiting room, and you even score a television of your very own, but because this is a small practice, you really get very little time to check anything out on the tube since they work so quickly.  I was unable to even locate the Spice Channel.I only hesitate to give a fifth star for two reasons.  One is that I have no skill as a dentist myself, so I am unable to tell if Dr. Park is really that talented or just good at making you feel like he knows what he is doing.  Now I could go all Steve Martin a la Little Shop of Horrors, but that really would not help me rate Dr. Park, which is the important part in judging (even though it may be fun as a second career).

I went to this dentist for years when I lived in Charlotte, from 1996 to 2009.  They seemed to be okay, though I had a few issues here and there. Once one dentist left me so long that the numbing for a small cavity filling wore off before he got back. Had to re-inject me and wait again while that one took effect. Another dentist (no longer works here) and the dental hygienist talked in a foreign language for a few seconds while they were working on me...and you know what that means as far as what (who) they were talking about...very uncomfortable... I've been blessed with pretty good teeth -- have only had two cavities that I remember, and those were tiny...one didn't even require numbing, and the other was borderline so I opted for it (the aforementioned absentee dentist).  I also had a couple of ""clean and seals"" where they grind out a soft spot in your enamel and then seal it to prevent it from becoming a cavity. I've since moved to another city and had to get another dentist here locally. On my first visit it was quickly determined that my new dentist would have to re-do everything that this dentist's office had done.  One of my (tiny -- hello?! this shouldn't have been hard!) cavity fillings had since fallen out, unbeknownst to me, and the seals were both poorly done and were leaking.  One of the seals was so bad that decay had formed under it and was starting to get bad -- nothing the new dentist couldn't clean out and fix up, but -- SHEESH!  My new dentist blasted out both seals, cleaned the decay under the one tooth, and redid the seals properly.  He also replaced the now-missing filling on the tiny cavity.Needless to say, I just dropped $300 (my out-of-pocket after insurance) to have this dentist office's work redone.

On one side you have caring, knowledgeable doctors who make an effort to connect with their patients. On the other side you have a management and front office that goes out of its way to make your visit experience as hellish as possible.  I've been going to these doctors since '04 and these shifts in culture only started within the last couple of years.We've had cancellations of appointments (that were made months in advanced) for no reason and at the last moment.  I've had their coordinator schedule back-to-back appointments between specialists and my doctor only to have them attempt to refuse seeing me because of my tardiness (which was expected and had been noted in the appointments by the coordinator herself).

In essence, I would have to schedule a doctor visit every 30 days to continue receiving a medicine that they had already been prescribing me for YEARS.

It's strange to be treated like you're at a 4-star hotel when visiting the Clinic, at least, that was my impression.  My father-in-law is in town from Puerto Rico.  He needed a procedure done pretty quick one day.  So I called the clinic's scheduling phone number and was able to get an appointment in an hour!  This isn't to say that everyone would get an appointment in an hour, so I guess we were lucky.  I was on the phone with an Alan, who told me where to go and what to do once we get there to ensure we get to the appointment on time.  He recommended valet parking at the Intercontinental Hotel, which we did.  That saved us at least 15 minutes.  Once we were in the clinic, we were able to find the doctor's office pretty quickly.  Since my father-in-law is considered an international patient, he had to register as an international patient, which took only 10 minutes.  Then, a worker from the international patients registration desk took us to talk to the finance guy, who basically took the credit card information.Finally, we were escorted to the office where the appointment was.  First, on floor 7, they took my father-in-law's vital signs and cleared him for the next step of the process.  We then went to the 8th floor where he was screened with questions.  Once we passed that test, we went to the 9th floor where the actual procedure was performed by the doctor.  Unfortunately, the doctor recommended surgery as a result of the procedure.So about a week and many follow-up visits later, my father-in-law had surgery and recovered at our home.  We were also assigned a very nice interpreter, not that we needed one.  Instead of interpreting, she was really there to comfort us and answer any questions we had during the process.  She would simply show up each time we had an appointment and she visited after the surgery too.This whole process left me in awe, not only of the physical monstrosity that is the Cleveland Clinic, but also of the superior level of service that they strive for to provide every moment of every day.I'm going here from now on for my appointments.Totally recommend!",16,_awu1HfNZWgBo6z9RU2CLA,5,z4ssQwmYQ730VItrUFZO0w,5/8/2011,5,2,23,9500 Euclid Ave,"{'AcceptsInsurance': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True}","['Ophthalmologists', 'Internal Medicine', 'Medical Centers', 'Doctors', 'Cardiologists', 'Optometrists', 'Hospitals', 'Health & Medical']",Cleveland,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,41.5027329,-81.6201534,Cleveland Clinic - Main Campus,Fairfax,44195,57,4,OH,Health & Medical,Ohio,Rodney

I scheduled a 90 minute deep tissue massage with Jessica. Including tip, I paid $89.98.

I almost felt as though I was the customer service professional providing the service, rather than the reverse - this was how far I had to go to establish a bond, and even then I felt more judged by Jessica than the reverse. Her attitude and demeanor were not something I'd want to experience again, and this is unfortunate given her chosen profession - helping people relax and feel comfortable.Also, the massage was decent - good when she got to my back, but the front leg and arm and neck massage was slightly awkward and uncomfortable, I recall. Also, though she asked about aromatherapy, I found it weird that she called it something like ""smelly stuff"" - unprofessional.

I have to admit that when I pulled into the complex (Acqua Blu Med Spa + Premier Plastic Surgery & Dermatology) for the first time I was speechless when I saw that, well, this building is hardly the nicest or newest in the area.  And the gray-as-gray-can-be sky didn't help.In December I treated myself to a photofacial to remove or at least minimize some small capillaries on my nose and some light sun spots on my cheeks.  I'd been interested in a photofacial for years, so when the procedure only took about 15 minutes--application of gel, 2 passes of the laser (once to treat red areas, once to treat brown spots), and application of moisturizer with SPF--I was disappointed.  Turns out I didn't really need a photofacial after all.  My results were basically non-existent; perhaps those with more significantly damaged skin would benefit from this procedure.  Most of all and as stated previously, I was disappointed in how short the treatment lasted.  It would have been nice to work in a facial massage, masque, or something similar to increase the bang-for-buck.  Had I paid full price I'd have felt taken advantage of.My microdermabrasion in February, on the other hand, was really nice--a great boost for my winter blah skin.  I thought the process was gentle, and I experienced no discomfort or redness or irritation at all.  My skin was softer, clearer, and looked brighter and refreshed for several weeks following the microderm.Definitely wouldn't recommend spending full price at Acqua Blu.

In two words, run quickly.This is a long story but trust that it is worth reading. I saw the same dentist from the time I was 4 till I was to 22. Same dentist my family saw, highly trusted, wonderful man. At 22 I moved from Murrysville to Pittsburgh to finish graduate school. Picked Dr Relis because he was closeby- naively, I figured any dentist is as good as the next (mistake #1). Got a cleaning, learned I had a between tooth cavity. Returned for filling (mistake number 2). Drilling for filling took ages. I began to worry.I expect my teeth to be a little sensitive after a filling but I felt like someone was trying to pull my teeth out of my head after he was done. Worse, days later my teeth still hurt like mad. At this point I realized...I'd perhaps made a mistake in selecting this dentist. So I went back to my childhood dentist in Murrysville and explained what was happening. He looked at my teeth, then at my x-rays from six months earlier. He removed his glasses, bowed his head, and rubbed his eyes with his hand. This is never a good sign. Then he looked up and said, pretty much verbatim: ""Your cavities were not that deep, if you had cavities at all. That area showed no decay six months ago. You have virtually no tooth left- it is just enough to hold the filling. Go back and see what he can do- if the guy offers you a root canal, get outta there (alternately he could fill my teeth with a sedative). I don't know how this guy sleeps with himself. ""I went back, and lo and behold Dr Relis did offer me a root canal - in fact, insisted I NEEDED one right away, and began putting my chair back so he could begin his work (apparently he just happens to have this kind of availability in his schedule midday). You see... root canals are very, very costly. As are the crowns that often follow them depending on the level of damage to the tooth, which in my case was, well, rather severe. Apparently the good dentist prefers to keep such work in house.Of course I left.Montage: Two sedative fillings courtesy of my childhood dentist, two root canals and two crowns through an endodontist he recommended, one visit to a lawyer (did I have a case? absolutely. would I recoup my $$ after paying him? never.) and about 7k later, I finally had comfort in my teeth. Lucky I had charged the initial bill on my credit card and was able to ensure that absolutely ZERO dollars of that went to Dr Relis. I could say much, much more about the desire to break legs and what have you, but I think that breaks Yelp TOS.In a nutshell: Choose your dentist very carefully. Drive far for a good one. And for the love of all that's holy, don't let this guy near your teeth.",42,qGHpCDLL3DFtAytDhn80Pg,6,oUnNJ211DegK-hRfvAQQfw,1/16/2010,1,3,13,4415 5th Ave,{'AcceptsInsurance': True},"['General Dentistry', 'Health & Medical', 'Dentists']",Pittsburgh,{},1,40.447309,-79.9513939,Relis Benjamin I DMD,Oakland,15213,5,4,PA,Health & Medical,Pennsylvania,Robin

I was looking for a new dentist and got turned away from a few full clinics. My coworker recommended Southlake because it's been her dentist for many years and I can see why. My experiences here have been the absolute best.I had my old dentist forward over my dental records and it all went smoothly. I don't have any dental issues (thank god) to complain about coming over to this new clinic. So really my experience has been for the 6 month cleanings so far. They have 7:20 AM slots open on some weekdays which means I can get into work usually right after 8:00 AM and not have to make up much time.On my most recent visit I had some chips in my front tooth that got repaired (just like a previous reviewer). Had a run-on with a fork and...well I lost. Dr. Sloan did a quick epoxy patch on the cracks and it's really amazing. You can't tell there was ever a problem. He finished this up in less than 30 minutes. Out the door it was about $55. Of course the biannual check-ups are covered by my insurance so no expense there.The waiting room here is super cozy with some leather chairs that practically eat you alive when you sit in them. There's a TV in the waiting room and one in each exam room where the hygienist will quickly offer you a remote to put on whatever you want. (Usually I just want to turn it off, haha!)

Most recently it was at the Charlotte 10 Miler in Balantyne. But the most memorable time was back in the summer at the 24 Hours of Booty ride in Charlotte. One of their doctors(?) was on site doing massage, stretching and perhaps mild adjustments and giving some consultation advice. I felt thoroughly pleased with the service and took a card swearing I'd be into the clinic to have a full review of my physical well being. Well being is perhaps not the best wording to use though, as I'm physically just tense and broken everywhere.I've been to a very basic chiropractor before. By basic I mean they churn you out like you're on an assembly line. Wait in a waiting room, they say ""next"", you come in, crack your neck and back and send you away in about 10 minutes or less. That's it. But that's not CSC. Here they go above and beyond ""basic chiropractor"". Before you get an adjustment you'll go through an orientation of sorts where they analyze how you're standing or sitting or whatever you're doing wrong to hurt yourself. They'll give you a list of exercises to do when you're not in the clinic getting adjusted or stretched. In the clinic they will do a light sort of massage to loosen up and stretch out your tense muscles prior to performing an adjustment on you. After a thorough adjustment you will be attached to some electrodes (I'm not sure specifically what the device is called) which vibrate your muscles to help relieve a bit of the potential pain after your adjustment. At least in my case they applied some KT tape as a ""gentle reminder"" to maintain my proper posture to prevent the pain from recurring so frequently.They're very friendly and accommodating and have an almost communal layout here for the physical therapy/chiropractic functions. I do pay quite a bit more than I did with my previous chiropractor ($65/visit here) however I'd say it's worth the improved quality of the treatment. As I loosen up more and build up the courage I may try some dry needling to see if that works too. But really, I'm just learning more about my body's ""bad habits"" and ways at this point - they do an excellent job of sharing that.

She did however offer to do the entire thing lymphatic. I agree, go to the bathroom, come back to fill out the paper work and she is being abrasively pushy about INSISTING I sit down instead of stand. It was just word and very hostile.

I had an evening appointment and I had just finished a day at my job of office monkey.  I had changed into a t-shirt because being in full office gear for 3 more hours was seriously going to chafe my morale. This meant I had minimal make up on, hair styled about 10 hours ago, and khaki pants.   I was asked no more than 3 times if I was over 18 years old (uh I'm out of college). I ended up volunteering to have the receptionist examine my driver's license!  Oddly everyone but the optometrist had some comment to make about my age or my appearance. (how effing rude, just look at my eyes and get me through the herd, yo)Next infraction... the REFUSAL to explain FEES upfront.  I had asked how much the exam would be and I explain I am there for both glasses and contacts.  AFTER I finish the exam -- I am curtly told that if I want contacts the fitting fee is an additional $80. (um I did want contacts and I did tell you that.)  I ask them to reduce the fee and am told to call back in the morning.    Third infraction... after bringing in my YEAR old glasses to get the lenses replaced, I am told that the frames are too ""cracked"" to receive new lenses.  Funny how the next optometrist I went to didn't have that problem.Fourth infraction.. After getting quotes from 3 other eye care facilities, I end up calling the next morning to ask about receive a reduced fee for a contact fitting.  I am told that the ""fitting"" they provide is superior service to all others in Madison and refuse to give me a reduced price, even after I explained that I was not fully informed of the fees.

The good news is that there was no pain; the bad involved my experience at First Choice Dental on South Park Street.  I am only giving a rating of two stars because the receptionists were extremely polite and kind.  I spoke to one of them on the phone for at least 5 minutes as we tried to arrange a time for me to come in.  After my interactions with them the politeness stopped and the bullying began.  The dental assistant was more interested in fixing her computer monitor that was crapping out than the patient. She crammed the X-Ray machine in my mouth and basically told me to tough it out while she fiddled with another computer for at least 2 minutes. (which is a really long time when some huge machine is chafing your effing mouth)  The dentist explained to me that I would need an expensive crown for about $1600.  He tried rationalizing it to me that it was ""mere pennies a day"" as this crown was going to last me 20 years. Additionally, the dentist (thinking that I was one of those uninsured eccentric millionaires) suggested that I get 4 of my other fillings replaced too as they were cracking.  Both of these people seemed to not hear me say at least 4 times, ""I'm not insured.""  I requested a temporary filling for the problem tooth no less than 3 times in which the dentist flat out refused.  At the end, I was ushered into a room where they discussed finances with me, and suggested that perhaps I ask my parents for help in order to get a crown or maybe I could take out a loan from a bank that they endorsed.  I hope it was that they just hate poor people, and they treat insured people better.

But you have to strive for consistency, you can't be so vastly different time to time because people won't know which way is up. They'll start to lose faith and worry about what next time will be like.No worries here, there won't be a next time. I'm appalled, angered and actually contemplated removing my first review (5-stars) but I felt it was important to see just how abysmal my experience was today as compared to last time. 3:50pmIt started with a woman at the front who asked me to fill out new patient paperwork even though as she was pulling out folders, shuffling papers and readying a clipboard I explained 3 times I had been there before. She told me she'd find my paperwork and asked me to sit down. Another woman called me up, the associate director of operations. She asked me for my insurance card and I again explained it should be on file... I had been there twice this year. She told me they had a new system and asked me to pull it up if I could. I took my seat and did just that. I went back up to the desk with my ID card on my phone, she said she found a copy in my folder and told me I could take a seat. Same woman called me back up to the desk and said it would be $105 today. Huh? For what? I haven't seen anyone or been diagnosed with anything? I told her that I thought it was $10 for an office visit. She said last time we didn't charge you enough, so it'll be $105 today and asked me if I wanted to pay the whole thing up front or in installments. Really now, WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I HAVEN'T SEEN A DOCTOR! What is $105? Seriously, where did you get that number? What am I paying for? She told me they'd ""figure it out"" and told me to take a seat. Time passes. (A lot of time.)4:30I'm finally taken back. Height. Weight. Blood pressure. Then the nurse leaves and the Doctor comes in.I explain my symptoms, she says she wants to run a throat culture. I'm guessing here she only listened to the fact that I have throat pain, a mild cough and post nasal drip, and neglected to hear the fact that I've had a low grade fever, chills and a lack of appetite. Times passes.A medical assistant comes in with not one but TWO throat cultures. Offices can run a quick test for strep on the spot, they can also send one out to a lab. The Doctor decided she wanted both. In my foggy haze I'm trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together but I just can't quite get there, but I also know it doesn't add up. Time passes. Doctor comes back and says their test shows it's not strep. (I'm shocked. ) She says they aren't going to send the other test to the lab because the in office test is 95% accurate. THEN WHY DID YOU PERFORM BOTH? Why not the in office test first, followed by the other? Advanced apologies to my insurance which I sincerely hope denies Concentra's claim. Time passes.I finally have some scripts for what this Doctor deems is acute sinusitis. 5:40The place is dark. I'm talking lights off y'all, everybody went home. There isn't even anybody at the desk anymore who could take a payment. I'm walked to my car because I'm the last person there.  But it doesn't end there. Now I'm at Walgreen's where I'm told one of the prescriptions has a $40 copay, and it's the equivalent of cough syrup and an antihistamine. The pharmacist points me towards OTC drugs that total $10 and achieve the same desired effect.Concentra, you've lost me.Not only in the confused WTF way, but as a patient too.

The architect of record is Albert Chase McArthur, who was once one of Wright's draftsmen and obviously he was heavily influenced by his employer and mentor. In fact, Wright consulted McArthur for a few months in the textile block construction which is one of the hotel's architectural trademarks. But let's get real. As talented as McArthur was, the owners knew Wright was the one with the marquee name and have played up the connection big time ever since its construction.To reinforce the same misconception I had, they added a signature Wright-designed stained glass in the lobby (photo: http://bit.ly/2wOrfC5) and the familiar Japanese-influenced stone sprites from Wright's Midway Gardens project in Chicago (photo: http://bit.ly/2fpJ7AJ), as well as naming the three onsite restaurants after Wright, including one that celebrates the actual architect, Frank & Albert's - even though poor McArthur gets second billing (photo: http://bit.ly/2horLVx). Driving here at night from Camelback, I couldn't tell how close I was getting to the hotel until I saw a small sign at a creek crossing (photo: http://bit.ly/2xBj9kg).The entrance was designed in the familiar prairie style accented by intricately designed blocks (photo: http://bit.ly/2ylbQu6). The low ceiling of the expansive lobby is covered completely in gold leaf, and the lamps, rugs and couches are all typically Wright in their angular and orb-focused design (photo: http://bit.ly/2xoc6Mi). Strolling outside to the back terrace, I saw more sprites and sat on a Morris chair that served nicely as a lounge seat. The hotel has changed hands a number of times and is now part of the high-end Waldorf-Astoria collection. Hell, I didn't stay here but rates start at $265 per night for a standard guest room to around $800 for a villa.

Unless of course you only want aerobic machines. they have those in spades.However... if they DID want to make this place serve that population, a) you need to have a TRX station that allows the straps to hang down and for people to work out below the anchor point. and if you aren't, you need to have enough space away from the anchor point such that you aren't right in the flow of foot traffic or nearly hovering over a machine. I love they you guys have TRX, but you gotta give it some room to breath.b) the climbing wall is definitely for kids (5.6 - 5.10a). I think there is one 5.11 (guessing 5.11a) and it's not very tall but they have the ability to set some routes (don't need many, one or two would be great) that really challenge people. Also, the flooring material is not a mat but rather that shredded rubber which for bouldering is almost asking for a sprained ankle.c) make the more unique items (Bosu balls, medicine balls, bands, etc.) more accessible and give people much more space to use them. even the personal training space isn't very large. which would be frustrating if you paid for PT and had to wait to use equipment.Don't get me wrong, the pool is fun and the outdoor option is great, but definitely geared toward kids. shame they couldn't put in long lap lanes but waterslides are pretty popular with the 10 and under crowd.",5,dEi4_bO8ydNHgcRNKV8q6g,2,T2xaR0ppKwuElE1aNkW77Q,11/16/2016,3,1,20,1616 W Ruby Dr,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'BikeParking': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Hair Salons', 'Sports Clubs', 'Fitness & Instruction', 'Trainers', 'Active Life', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Gyms']",Tempe,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,33.3402863,-111.9647327,Life Time Fitness,,85284,187,3.5,AZ,Beauty & Spa,Arizona,Mike

I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.  Well, guess what? Today was that day!With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved ""Gabi time"" as I like to call my downtime.  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the ""book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it.""  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven!I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.  I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.  I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out!The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine... I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.  After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book... It was so peaceful.  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it!So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!

In the past six plus years since my initial review, I've been extremely loyal to The Root.  I've lost track of the number of times I've visited, and I've seen a handful of stylists but I cannot think of one time that I left the salon not feeling beautiful.  Five star experiences consistently... you don't find that very often!Since my last review, the salon also moved locations, just a tad bit south of their original location.  The new space is awesome.  It has a great, friendly vibe and it's super high tech.  Everyone that works there is friendly and easy to talk to... they really do live by the values on their website: relationships, creativity, fun, learning, humor, hard work, happiness and respect.I typically go in for a cut and standard color (ever since the greys started coming in), but I once got a pink streak in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, and I've gotten a brow wax and a make-up application at The Root as well.  They have plenty of services to offer... my husband has been in for both hair cuts and beard trims too!As mentioned above, I've been loyal to TRS, but I've seen a handful of stylists.  I trust anyone that Laurxc3xa9n hires, and I usually just book ahead with whom ever can accommodate my often busy schedule.  In addition to Laurxc3xa9n herself, I've seen Jillian and Dana, Desiree and Forest, and have been pleased every time.  Huge shout-out to Forest whom I saw most recently for the perfect color job and double french braid I requested at the last minute instead of a blow-out.  She is seriously a braiding expert.  It was perfect!I left the salon and headed to my kids' T-Ball game where I got a ton of compliments on my braids.  It then lasted through dinner, a night of sleep, and a hot yoga class the next day!  Thank you again, Forest!

The staff was super friendly, the facility is relaxing and gorgeous, the showers are amazing, the therapists are extremely gifted, the amenities are top notch, the fitness center is more than adequate, and the boutique is stocked with useful and stylish product as well.I had a facial with Lena and a Thai massage with Robert.  My sister also had a facial with Lena and we both loved her!  She also had a massage with Denny - she said he was extremely professional and talented.

I never make the time to blow out my own hair, so it is a treat to go here and have it done for you.  I received a gift card for a blowout from this place ($35 value) when they first opened, and I finally made my way in to use it this past week...I made my appointment online on their website which was easy and I received a confirmation immediately.  (Gotta love technology when it works!)  I showed up a few minutes early and was greeted and welcomed in.  I was offered water to drink... I guess my pregnant belly gave it away that I wasn't going with anything stronger!  After looking at the style book, I chose to go with ""The Manhattan,"" a sleek and smooth style, and requested that Larysa, the girl assigned to do my blowout, use a round brush for slight curl underneath.  I also added on a ""floater,"" a 10-minute scalp massage ($10), which was awesome.  Half way through my session, Larysa wasn't feeling well, so someone else took over, but I know that was likely a fluke.  I enjoyed watching ""Julie and Julia"" during my time there... I guess they show girly movies all of the time which is a nice touch.  They also offer plenty of magazines and snacks.  (I went with a cranberry trail mix which was a perfect little afternoon bite).I was in and out within an hour and if it weren't for my gift card, it would've been just over $60 (including tip), which I think is a tad bit on the pricey side, but a huge treat nonetheless.  I was promptly emailed a thank you and receipt for my visit... another nice touch.  Bottom line: I think Drybar will be hugely successful in the Scottsdale Quarter location and I know they will continue to grow nationally as well.  I believe they are opening up in San Fran next.  I'll be back for a special occasion, I'm sure, but if anyone is looking to get me a gift, I'd gladly accept a giftcard to Drybar as well...

Since that last review, my life has changed quite a bit... I've gotten married and gone from a single membership to a family membership.  I have two kids, and in addition to using the gym for cardio, classes and swimming, I also take advantage of the Kids Club, the Cafe, a personal trainer, the spa, and most recently, we celebrated my 5 year old son's birthday at this club.One thing that has not changed is the five star rating... Here are some of the reasons why:-I'm greeted with a smile each and every visit... those friendly faces make a huge difference - especially when I'm coming in half asleep before 6am!-Roger Cahill.  If you're looking for a reliable and awesome personal trainer with plenty of knowledge and experience, great energy, creative workouts, etc... Roger rocks.  In 3+ years of training with him twice a week, I've had a different workout every single time.-Top notch yoga instructors: Beri, Heidi and Meghan are my favorites.  -Solid spin instructors as well... I don't get to spin as often as I like anymore, but if you want a kick-ass workout, just head to a class taught by Amanda, Miki, Patrice or Julie!-Massages from Charlie in the spa... I don't get these often enough!-Kids Club staff - my kids always have a good time in the kids club... and as mentioned above, I just had these folks host a birthday party for my son.  Nicole was incredible to work with and I must shout out to Laura, Isaac, and Gino for the hard work they did during the party too.  It was a blast and such a pleasure!-Cafe staff - These guys also helped out at the aforementioned party, but we order kids food here often and plenty of smoothies too.  I love the newer addition of the adult lounge and the service with a smile!-Locker Room amenities.  The locker rooms are kept clean, water pressure rocks, and all the amenities you need...

Nail Spa at Lincoln View is now my go-to nail salon, and it has been for quite some time.  I started going here consistently for one reason: Lia!  Lia has been taking care of me for at least two years now.  I followed her to this salon and haven't looked back.  It is a bit on the pricier side, but it's worth it.  The owners, Jimmy and Demi are super friendly, and of course, Lia always takes amazing care of me whether I see her for a pedicure with acupressure/reflexology, a manicure, a wax, etc... She does facials too!  Lia has taken care of me through both of my pregnancies and she really knows her stuff.The salon is clean, the semi-private rooms are great, and they actually recently added on to have some additional rooms including a party room for small groups.  This salon offers their customers a bottle of water (nice touch), plenty of magazines to choose from, and pretty much any color of the rainbow when it comes to polish.I recently had my husband join me for a visit and since it was his birthday, I let him have the appointment with Lia and I had Annie do my nails... she did a great job also.

But once I arrived, I was extremely impressed at this little hidden gem of a community in the Northwest Valley. I wanted to go check this place out since they are participating in ""Hawt On Yelp,"" and since I was making the drive, I rewarded myself with an appointment for a facial and brow wax.  Lucky for me, my appointment was with Suzanna, and she was incredible.  But let me back up a second...  before I met Suzanna, I met Maggie.  Maggie gave me a quick tour of the place and brought me to my locker where I met the most comfy robe I've ever put on my body.  And then I was escorted to the heaven that lay ahead of me in Suzanna's room.We started with the brow wax and I could tell Suzanna was good as she carefully explained what she was going to do to make sure the brows were even and cleaned up just right to accent my eyes.  Next the facial began and she talked / educated me just enough so that I could relax and enjoy but learn a little something too... several scrubs, a partial pumpkin peel, a mask, exfoliation, and moisturizer later, I was given a choice: hands, feet, or neck and shoulders.  I chose feet.  Deep exhale.  No words can explain how amazing this was.  I didn't want my time to end, but it did... :(And as I type this, I wish that Alvea Spa was just a bit closer to home.

Then I had to wait more until they could find someone else to do my service. Luckily, the girl who did was wonderful. Oddly, we did not go back to the waxing room. She did my wax at one of the shampoo bowls. She gave me some great advice about lip waxing. She said that I should try a cold wax since I blister. They offer this service there and if I had asked for this far enough in advance, they could have done it. I haven't found a spot in Atlanta that does this yet.On my second visit, there were no issues and I was scene quickly. The girl again was very nice and did a lovely job on my brows.

His regular place was closed for the day so as usual, I turned to Yelp for life advice. This place was close by (then again, for this Miami girl, everything is close by in a town like this), had decent reviews, and wasn't going to break the bank. We walked in and were told it would be about a 30 minute wait, which was no problem since we were a walk-in on the weekend. Upon checking-in, Yelp offered me a free MVP upgrade. I'm still kind of confused as to what this means, and the employees were very confused about my check-in offer, since literally no one had ever seen it before. Plus, they said, ""all our new clients automatically get the free upgrade"". We just needed a regular haircut, but I guess we were getting the MVP upgrade which meant a shampoo, hot face towel, and shoulder massage.The stylist did a great job and was very personable. She chatted with my nephew and made sure he was happy with the end result.The problem came to when we paid and were charged for the upgrade which was supposedly free for first timers, plus I also had the Yelp check-in offer. Nope, those were just for the upgrade on the upgrade, or something of the sort. So I took my 15 year old nephew to a sports-themed supercuts for a basic haircut and ended up spending $30 for bells and whistles that we didn't expect or even need. He doesn't care about a warm towel on his face! His regular place charges $8, I wish they would have been more clear from the beginning. Again, the haircut was good and the stylist was friendly.

Red Rock's luxurious facility both surprised and impressed me - there's a lot to do!This casino resort has a cornucopia of features, including a bowling alley, spa, food court, multiple restaurants, and conference center capabilities. Their hotel lobby lounge features a 32-foot long chandelier, draped by an elegant staircase. There's a few stores, and a Starbucks overlooking the lobby. The casino's decor is sharp, and the restaurants lining it mirror that theme. The nearly 3,000 slot machines can confound if you're trying to find people, so pay attention to your surroundings.We had a spacious suite near the spa, with a view of the Strip and top-notch amenities: modern decor, huge soft mattresses, a comfy couch, a widescreen plasma TV, and a convenient bottle of Patron (costs extra). Loved the bathroom, and the luxurious shower. The toilet had a phone by it, and the marble tub, a TV. Besides hearing wind whistling one morning (it was crazy windy out there), Red Rock's hotel, casino, and lounges all had a fit and finish that made our dollars feel well-spent.Hotel service was stellar. When I needed help late-night, both Tanya (at the front desk) and a bellhop assisted. When we needed a random feminine hygiene product, not only did room service stock necessities, a staffer delivered the goods to our door minutes later. When hunger hit, concierge Stephanie pointed out some nearby Thai restaurants.If you're planning on heading to the Strip, keep in mind that Red Rock is off-strip.

Comfortable?!!!I'd like to see the Nike ColeHaan ""geniuses"" behind these so called comfy shoes, walk the strip in the boots from hell.Anyways - after a night full of painful foot issues, and chaotic club lines - we decided that the three Miss Yelps were in dire need of some pampering.And so after doing some Yelp research beforehand - we decided on Qua. Just like Nicole C - said - Qua Spa is the Ultimate.The treatments are a little pricey - but I've heard they're well worth it.  (Connie loved her massage). Nicole and I decided to just use the facilities. For about 40 dollars, you can get access to the dream facilities that make up Qua.For forty dollars you get access to big Romanesque indoor pools of warm (Tepidarium), hot (Caldarium) and cold water (Frigidarium), with sensual overhead rain showers.  Pure aqua bliss. You can spend all day dipping your body in each, and once your body is relaxed and revitalized by the mineral enriched waters,  you can grab the latest gossip magazine and lounge on the reclined hot stone chairs, which heat up your core - allowing for one of the best naps you'll ever take.If you're done sitting poolside, you can then head to the lounge area, to grab some fruity hot and cold teas (all teas throughout the spa are organically grown with only natural ingredients and flavors ). One thoroughly hydrated, you can wrap your robe tightly around you, as you make your way to the next heavenly phase in the adventure - the Laconium and Arctic Ice Room.The Laconium room is the sauna. It's the perfect place to clear your pores and sweat out any vodka and redbulls injested the night before.  Lying back on the wooden benches, you feel your body become lifeless, as your forehead heats up. Once throughly warmed - you head to the Arctic Room.The Arctic Ice Room has heated floors and benches where you can sit perched as you watch snow fall before you. It's soothing, and magical, and takes you back to the excitement you felt when young. Utter awe at the early signs of resh falling winter.Feeling the chill, you emerge from the brisk world  - back into Qua reality  - an amazing shower with high quality shampoo and conditioner (Qua even has a handy contraption to get the water out of your bathing suit in a matter of seconds)Feeling alive, awake, and amazing  - you slather yourself in moisturizer, brush your hair, get dressed, and leave Qua a better and healthier person.If you're going to Vegas - go big.

It was and still is a very complete resort, a property with a little bit of everything. GVR recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, which in Vegas years means the novelty has worn off slightly. Despite that, it remains a great destination for all and is a great value for any stay.Similarly to Red Rock, GVR is off the strip. So off as a matter of fact, it's in Henderson (i.e. not Las Vegas). Relax I-only-stay-on-the-strip fans, it's a 10-15 minute shuttle ride at best from McCarran airport and is probably faster to get to than the Sahara, which is technically still on the strip. But like any good off strip property and especially those in Henderson, it means this joint is likely a locals casino (#1).As a hotel, GVR is definitely delivers. There are a multitude of room types, all of which are modern, contemporary, and feature some of the most comfy beds I've slept in. Everything from the regular sized rooms to the mega suites that could sleep 30, are available and for far more reasonable prices than most of the ones along Las Vegas Blvd. And at nearly 500 of them, there is plenty to choose from. I say, try to score a room near their pools - the view of the strip is nice, as is the amenities poolside.Casino enthusiasts should be able to appreciate the large casino space, which offers over 70 table games and over 2,000 gaming machines. Blackjack fans should be able to get their fill of over 30 tables dedicated to the game and poker fans will have a  decent variety of games to chose from as well. Their player rewards program is competitive, comp points from play is definitely transferrable to other Station properties. Dealers are usually quite friendly and the cigarette smoke is controlled rather well for a large space. The cocktail staff could definitely use an upgrade, but I digress.In terms of eats, there is a decent selection but the outstanding venues are a bit limited. Hank's Steaks & Martinis (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson) is the obvious winner of the bunch and then there is the pitiful TIdes Oyster Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tides-oyster-bar-henderson). I echo the pains of eating at Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-cafe-henderson) though the Feast (Around The World) Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/feast-buffet-henderson-3) has been fantastic and mediocre at varying times. It's no In-N-Out, but Fatburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fatburger-henderson-2) is gut bustingly good. Sushi + Sake (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-sake-las-vegas) is a fun time, especially for their AYCE deal. Italian joint Terra Verde (http://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-verde-henderson) is decent during lunch, though I much preferred it when Hell's Kitchen winner Rock was still running the show.GVR has a lot of random amenities, which really distinguish it from it's nearby (or far away depending on how you look at it) properties. Like the Red Rock, there is a movie theater. The Pond (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pond-henderson), is a real cool and relaxing alternative to their sick pools. A great place to catch an outdoor concert is at The Backyard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-backyard-henderson) and Ovation (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovation-henderson) is a real concert venue. Every casino has a center floor bar and in GVR's case, it's the Drop Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/drop-bar-henderson). I'd also recommend visiting the Lobby Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobby-bar-henderson) as it's probably the closest thing to a club GVR has. The property may not boast a lot of shopping, but it sits right next to The District (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-district-at-green-valley-ranch-henderson), a village of boutique and luxury stores, just perfect for those looking for an escape from the casino. It's rarely ever crowded, but then again, neither is the casino.Though GVR could probably use an upgrade on a few things, the property itself is good enough to warrant a 4.5 star rating. It's versatile, stylish, and spacious enough for all visitors. Folks who are teetering the idea of staying off the strip with almost everything at their disposal, should consider GVR as their next destination.___________(#1) This is a very, very good thing.",5,6kkxRV8H9SQLybj0xnEbMw,2,1ekmjgWn1knK55pbyH_1Kg,1/8/2012,5,2,68,2300 Paseo Verde Pkwy,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': True}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BikeParking': True, 'GoodForKids': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Resorts', 'Hotels', 'Day Spas', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Hotels & Travel', 'Casinos', 'Arts & Entertainment', 'Event Planning & Services']",Henderson,"{'Monday': '0:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Friday': '0:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '0:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '0:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '0:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '0:00-0:00'}",1,36.020552,-115.089984,Green Valley Ranch Resort & Spa,Anthem,89052,756,3.5,NV,Beauty & Spa,Nevada,Jando

Posh, luxurious in its own way, there are too many good adjectives to describe Station's finest casino in the land.  Its places like the Red Rock that will eventually lead people off the overrated strip and into places like this and Green Valley Ranch.Situated near the Red Rock Canyon, this secluded resort may seem far from a lot of things, but as a boutique resort, they have all the bases covered for people with all kinds of interest.  Ever since its expansion of the second tower at the end of 2006, the dramatic difference can be felt in the hotel's beautiful rooms and expanded convention space.This is a locals casino destination and becoming more and more popular by the day.  Virtually everything is great here, from the food to the pool to the relaxed casino.  Nightlife is decent with plenty of eye candy over at Cherry Nightclub and the trendy restaurants within the casino are great.  Suites are spacious, well decorated, and very comfortable.  And by comfortable, I mean probably one of the best beds I've ever slept in.Few resort properties like this have impressed me to the magnitude that Red Rock has.  This place has it all and is an ideal family destination with plenty of food options (larger food court), a fabulous theater, and probably one of the best bowling alleys in Vegas.  Comped players will enjoy their stay, in addition to the visitors who are just looking for a place to get away.

Canyon Ranch has spa locations throughout many warm weather locations from Miami to Arizona and this LV version maybe among the most decked out of them all.There is a departure aspect from host resort to spa facilities, an oasis from the Venetian if you will, as the Canyon Ranch theme is very different from the rest of the Palazzo / Venetian. Luxury accommodations aren't quite to the standard of the Wynn or Cosmo per se, but they've got more than enough to satisfy the average spa goer.There is rock climbing, a full scale gym with treadmills, weights, and the works. My personal favorite activity is the sauna + massage.

When we called, we asked how much it was for a session and were told $38, and asked us how we found out about them. When we said Yelp, they said that it will be $34/hour. When we got there, we were ushered into a dimly lit room with comfortable armchairs to sit in. A big wooden tub is brought out with a plastic bag lined and filled with hot water to soak our feet in. My masseuse was Anna who immediately went to work on my back and shoulders. After about 10 mins on my upper back, I felt myself relax and slump over the cushions she had placed on my lap.I've had Chinese foot massage before but they've always hurt me so badly I couldn't go about my daily duties for a few days. There was none of this here. Anna exerted enough pressure, yet, was not torturing me with pain.My friend wanted a 75 minute treatment so all 3 of us did as well. We had a good 30 minutes of back, neck and shoulder massage and then she moved onto your head, scalp and ears before doing the arms, hands and fingers. When that was finished she started working on my feet and toes. I actually fell asleep can you believe it? I've NEVER fallen asleep during one of these before.She then massaged my legs and then laid 3 ottomans together so we could lay on it face-down so she could work on my back. Throughout the treatment, I was drinking the herbal tea they had provided -- I suggest you do this because it will make you go and pee to flush out all the toxins in your body.When it was all over, I stood up and was wobbly. I lost my balance slightly because I was so relaxed. I'm going to give them 5 stars for the treatment, but am taking off a star because I didn't realize until later, they never gave us the Yelp discount. We received 15 minutes of extra treatment and were charged $48. We were told the Yelp discount would make the one hour treatment $34, so an extra 15 minutes should not cost 14 extra dollars.

As prevalent as foot massage establishments are becoming, I have to admit I was a Foot Massage Virgin until 2 months ago. And, I can say hands-down, the second time around at PF&S blew my first experience at SF's Wonderfoot Health Center out of the water!Although I love wearing stilettos, they do not love me and no matter how many GG shots I take to numb the pain, I end up wearing them as bracelets by midnight. As we were planning our Vegas trip, Nicole S. found PF&S and after seeing the 4.5 STAR rating, we knew we had to go there during out trip. Come Friday, 3.5.10, our feet were already sore from the previous night at Tryst, even though I had my shoes off half the time. *SIGH* If we (I), intended to survive the next 2 nights, we (I) needed a foot massage, and needed one badly! APPOINTMENT:Walk-ins are welcome. However, just to ensure they could accommodate me and my gfs, Nicole S. called at 3 PM for a same-day appointment at 3:30 PM.LOCATION:PF&S is in Chinatown and is located in one of those Asian Plaza's similar to the ones in the San Gabriel Area of LA. It's approximately a $13 cab ride (10 min) cab ride from the strip. EXPERIENCE:1) We were warmly welcomed in by the staff and seated in leather recliners side-by-side each other.2) I received a cup of rose tea while Anna, my masseuse prepared the footbath.3) While my feet soaked in the footbath, I sat on the ottoman while she worked on my head, face, neck, shoulders, upper and lower back. It was by far the BEST non-oil massage I've ever had! Anna used trigger point therapy on my head, temples, and neck and I could feel the pent up stress just melt away. On my shoulders and back, she used a combo of acupressure and long strokes to knead away all the knots I had. I especially loved it when she used her entire forearm and went back and forth against each backbone...it felt so good, it made my EYES-ROLL-IN-BACK-OF-MY-HEAD!4) After 25 minutes, Anna dried off my feet, and had me sit back on the recliner and gave me a hand and arm massage which consisted of acupressure, kneading, and strokes. The hand massage was blissful and brought me back memories of my rave days!5) After 5 minutes, Anna went to the best part....the FOOT AND LEG MASSAGE! She put a balm on my feet and calves that felt a mixture of cream and shea butter. It was velvety smooth and intensified the effect of the massage even more. She started with trigger point therapy on certain parts of my feet, and then followed it with long strokes on the arch of my foot. I have many problems with the balls of my feet, so when Anna went to town on this part, it was Ahhhhhhhh, ORGASMIC!6) The last 2 minutes, ended with a thigh massage where Anna kneading my thigh with her fists. SERVICE:The staff at PF&S are very friendly, professional, and can speak conversational English (so there shouldn't be any awkward laguage barriers). Anna was very sweet and asked several times if I was ok and if the pressure was good. The pressure was perfect; it was gentle yet firm on the knots that needed to be worked out. PRICE:The decal outside the window stated $28 for 45 minutes, but we did the $38 for 1 hour. The staff at PF&S works hard, so please be mindful and tip accordingly. :)AMBIANCE:No frills establishment w/ a very simple and relaxing atmosphere. There are two flat LCDs on the Chinese CNN channel (muted) and Chinese classical music playing in the background. There are two rows of leather recliners; 10 total. We'll definitely be back on our next Vegas trip in 3 months! Vegas was a blast as usual and I definitely accomplished one of my goals: Happy Ending @ Vegas....CHECK! No pun intended of course...",31,RS0czUn_o_jEjh-_0Pou_A,20,oku3HsB2aq967SMqkPWD2A,3/10/2010,5,20,34,"5700 Spring Mountain Rd, Ste Q","{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'BikeParking': True, 'AcceptsInsurance': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Day Spas', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Massage']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '11:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Friday': '11:00-0:00', 'Wednesday': '11:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '11:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '11:00-0:00', 'Saturday': '11:00-0:00'}",1,36.1262438,-115.2192607,Pure Foot & Spa,Chinatown,89146,87,3.5,NV,Beauty & Spa,Nevada,Cherylynn

I guess that's what I get for Waking Up In Vegas...As you can imagine, my debauchery from the previous night left me severely hungover so after getting a bite to eat at Grand Lux Cafxc3xa9, my friend suggested that we all go to Canyon Ranch Spa Club for some ""Steam Therapy"".  On Saturday, 2.19.11, we (party of six) came to CRSC at around 1 PM. There are two employees at the front desk. It took about 10 minutes to check-in and pay. There's a women, men and co-ed section in the spa. We stayed at the women's only section. FEE$40/day pass to use the gym and spa facilities. HOWEVER, it's only $20/person if your hotel room (Palazzo or The Venetian) is charged with a resort fee. If it's not, I highly recommend you paying the $17.95 one-time resort fee at the spa because it will cover everyone in your party. My friend paid the resort fee, so we ended up saving about $17/person. LOCKER ROOMYou will be provided a magnet key wristlet to access your locker. Your robe will be provided in your locker. TIP: BRING YOUR OWN SLIPPERS/FLIP FLOPS! TRUST ME!The pressure point slippers that's provided are the most UNCOMFOTABLE slippers ever! With each step, it felt like I was walking on pebble stone pavement. EVERYONE was complaining about how painful they were and that we were better off wearing out 5-inch stilettos from the previous night...no joke! I hated those slippers so much, I wanted to BURN mine after leaving!AQUAVANA THERMAL ENVIRONMENTSVarious aquathermal environments that are designed to help with muscle relaxation, increase oxygen flow and most importantly RID YOUR BODY OF TOXINS! The perfect ""morning after"" remedy after a night of copious drinking!ROOM #1: IGLOOExactly as the name says, it's basically a big freezer. My least favorite of all the rooms because of the cold temperature. ROOM #2: JACUZZ WITH HEATED LOUNGERSThe jacuzzi (bathing suit optional) could accommodate about 8-10 people. I LOVED the heated loungers (there were 6). They were made of some type of Styrofoam material that was firm yet soft. The loungers were so warm and comforting that I could have slept on it the whole day.ROOM #3: HERBAL  LACONIUM (WET STEAM ROOM) - HANGOVER CURE!!!!!If you're not use to humid heat, the Herbal Laconium room may be too much to handle in the beginning. HOWEVER, after several minutes, your body will adjust to the heat and it will become very bearable.  As I closed my eyes, breathed in deeply and exhaled, I could feel my body releasing all the tequila and goose through my pores and my pounding headache becoming fainter and fainter.  TIP: Drink plenty of water beforehand and pick up an iced towel (to cover your face) in the Jacuzzi room which will make it much easier to breathe in the steam room.  ROOM #4: Finnish Sauna (Dry Heat Room)Not a fan of dry heat rooms as I feel like I'm stuck in a charcoal bbq minus the charcoal. ROOM #5: Crystal Steam Room (Aromatherapy Steam Room)Saving the best for last! The aromatherapy steam room is less intense than the Herbal Laconium room and the fragrant floral scents will enhance your mood. THE QUIET ROOM/LOUNGEEnd your Aquavana Session at the quiet room where you can lay on plushy oversized sofas while reading trashy magazines and munching on fresh apples, bananas and oranges. It was so quiet and serene that I ended up taking a 10-minute power nap. I woke up refreshed with my pounding headache all gone!SHOWER/MAKEUP ROOM*10-15 private showers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash in each one*Personal sink area with lotions, deodorant, hair care products, hair dryer, combs, brushes, etc*If you need a curling iron or flat iron, you can get it at the front deskTIP: If you need a razer, shower cap, and/or towels, make sure to grab them before getting into the shower room. They're located near the entrance way to the showers.OVERALL LAYOUTThe CRSC is BIG and I didn't even know how big until I got lost and ended up on the men's side. It's confusing to say the least and it was like a maze to get out. If you suffer from ""Waking Up In Vegas"" syndrome like I always seem to, I highly recommend coming to the CRSC to get you out of your funk!",12,eWKZyDPXdkhrT8v8XD2OrQ,3,dPXJNnBIYeIETYy01Euvbg,2/28/2011,3,7,23,"3355 Las Vegas Blvd S, Ste 1159","{'BusinessParking': {'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 3, 'BikeParking': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': True, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Hair Salons', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Gyms', 'Active Life', 'Health & Medical', 'Nutritionists', 'Day Spas', 'Fitness & Instruction']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '6:00-20:00', 'Tuesday': '6:00-20:00', 'Friday': '6:00-20:00', 'Wednesday': '6:00-20:00', 'Thursday': '6:00-20:00', 'Sunday': '6:00-20:00', 'Saturday': '6:00-20:00'}",1,36.1226902,-115.1701939,Canyon Ranch SpaClub - Las Vegas,The Strip,89109,465,3.5,NV,Beauty & Spa,Nevada,Cherylynn

I'm no stranger to pain and enjoy deep pressure massages, so Chinese foot massages/reflexology are right up my alley b/c done right, a  ""good"" pain releases all the pent up tension. So with most of the reviews boasting how awesome Good Foot Spa was, I decided to pay them a visit during my Vegas trip.My friend and I came to GFS on Friday, 7.30.10 at 4 PM. We had made an appt one day prior.There's a standard process for a Chinese foot massage/reflexology. First, you're brought warm tea and crackers. You feet is then soaked in plastic lined bucket of warm water while you're given a head, neck, shoulder and arm massage. Your masseuse then massages your calves and feet and finishes by flipping you over on the recliner and giving a back and butt massage. So, it's actually a full body massage (clothed) and the foot massage portion is about 1/3 of the massage time.Although the process at GFS was similar to other massage places, the overall feeling and results were NOT.I wasn't able to get my masseuse's name b/c she didn't speak English. When I asked her in Cantonese if she understood, she replied back, ""I speak 'Chinese' "". Uhhh, ok...1. Instead of getting a head massage, my masseuse placed lotion onto the palm of her hands and rubbed it into my scalp. She then repeatedly SCRAPED MY SCALP WITH HER NAILS for 20 minutes. Needless to say, I was cringing in pain the entire time. 2. The neck and shoulder massage was probably the highlight of the entire massage. It lasted for about 10 minutes and strong kneading was used to release the pent up tension.3. My masseuse then massaged my arms for 10 minutes, which I can't even call it a ""massage"". She didn't bother to put lotion on my arms which resulted in my skin stretching and pulling (aka Indian Burn) as she forcefully ran her thumbs up/down my forearm. 4. Afterwards, she gave me a foot massage, but mainly concentrated on my calves. What little she did to my feet did nothing to relieve my sore feet. She used her thumbs to rub up/down my arch several times and cracked my toes. When she massaged my ankle, she dug her thumbs into it, which made my flinch in pain. 5. Finally, she flipped me over and gave me a back massage. She ran her forearm along my spine back and forth. I like strong pressure and although she used a lot of force, something about it just didn't feel right. PRICE:$38 for 60 minutes. CC's accepted, but they appreciate tip in cash. Oh yah, btw, I mentioned Yelp for the 10% off and they had no clue what I was talking about. I tried to explain that I saw a promo on their Yelp page and they thought I was looking for a person named ""Yelp"". :XAMBIANCE/Dxc3x89COR:GFS is clean however, it's very dark inside. There are about 4-5 small cheesy pink painted rooms w/ about 3 recliners in each. For the novice, it may look a bit shady. However, as with most Chinese foot massages you're paying for their services and not the ambiance, so a bare boned dxc3xa9cor w/ mix matched walls, linens, and furnishings is typical. I think we were the only ones there at the time, so it was pretty quiet except for the occasional exchange btw my masseuse and my friend's masseuse. However, as an fyi, when these foot massages places do get busy, the environment is not serene. WHY I WILL NEVER RETURN:I've been to about 7-8 different foot massage places in SF, LA, and LV and this one is definitely on the bottom of my list. Why? 80% of the time, my massage was uncomfortable and painful. I know the difference btw ""good"" and ""bad"" pain and my pain was the latter. I left with an itchy scalp and oily hair. And, 2-3 days later my inner right ankle became sore and bruised and my arms were tender to the touch.Oh, Yelp...what happened??? *Sigh*We should have went to Pure Foot and Spa down the road instead...http://www.yelp.com/biz/pure-foot-and-spa-las-vegas#hrid:oku3HsB2aq967SMqkPWD2A",12,HRLHrJudlNsmtY-je3PDLQ,5,_zOaJ9zZ80Pm-nT4syn_6g,8/11/2010,2,6,11,4545 W Spring Mountain Rd,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 1, 'BikeParking': False, 'AcceptsInsurance': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False, 'WheelchairAccessible': True}","['Beauty & Spas', 'Massage', 'Day Spas']",Las Vegas,"{'Monday': '10:00-0:00', 'Tuesday': '10:00-0:00', 'Friday': '10:00-1:00', 'Wednesday': '10:00-0:00', 'Thursday': '10:00-0:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-1:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-1:00'}",1,36.12622862,-115.2033234,Good Foot Spa,Chinatown,89102,204,3.5,NV,Beauty & Spa,Nevada,Cherylynn

Several friends raved about the experience with such remarks as ""opening up the Google search of your brain"" to ""feeling like the 1 hour mark after 'shroom tea"" to ""mentally going to Mars"".  Their levels of sobriety ranged from stone cold to having smoked an ounce in the parking lot.  I was somewhere in between.      The friendly attendant, John, clearly explained what to do and how to operate the pod.  Being a first timer, I also watched a 6 minute video on how to maximize my float time which offered some helpful suggestions (body position, breathing) while glazing over some new age, self improvement stuff.  John also informed me to hang in their relaxation room upon finishing since many feel disoriented and extremely euphoric afterwards.  Uhhh..what??  So I get out of the shower, put the ear plugs in, get in the pod.....""And I'm floating in a most peculiar way""I initially found the whole thing a bit comical.  Here I am...naked, in a dark and confined space, lying in 93.5 degree water...isn't this a torture method in Guantanamo Bay?  But after I got over the initial weirdness, things got interesting....   ""And the stars look very different today""It definitely felt like drifting in outer space.  My mind darted through a billion thoughts before I was able to end up in a kind of neutral, semi-conscious, relaxed zone.  I could not believe I was in the pod for only an hour as it felt much longer than that.They claim health benefits like the improvement of memory/sports performance/sleep quality, alleviating PMS, helping with creativity, softer skin etc.  Let me tell you....my PMS was fuckin loooong gooooone!!!  :P  I don't know about this experience helping with all that, but I definitely left in a prolonged state of relaxation.

After being sick of contacts and glasses for 15+ years, she finally wanted to get it done.After some research and speaking with a few facilities, it seemed like the best choice was either here or Lasik of Nevada.  We chose Siems based on our talk with the consultant, price for the exact same treatment and also their proximity to our home.  My wife didn't want to schlep it all the way to Henderson for follow ups.  Dr. Siems made us feel comfortable right away upon the first meeting.  His office is very nice.  The lobby feels spa-like.  Needless to say we were nervous when the big day finally came for her to get the procedure done.  You hear that there's a high 90% success rate but a person only has one pair of eyes.  Dr. Siems and his staff made my wife as comfortable as possible (valium helped).  I was able to view the whole procedure on a television outside of the operating room and it definitely made me wince a little when they cut the lens and started shooting the lasers in her eyes. The whole procedure took less than 30 minutes.  She then took another valium and slept for about 18 hours.  She was able to see very clearly the next day and it just improved from there.  Post operation checkups are included in the price so the day after, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year were all taken care of.  Now that it has been well over a year, she says it's one of the best things she's ever done in life.  I've worn glasses more than half of my life and feel like the fat guy at Mr Olympia or the dude with no tattoos in a tattoo parlor when I go in there.  They always ask me when I am going to do it.

Paolo D, Regina P, David S and Julie S all give very helpful and detailed reviews on how it'll all go down so you should read them.  I have a few things to add:- Bring flip flops.  They didn't supply them for me and I walked around barefoot the whole time.  It wasn't bad but I was running out of a couple of the sauna rooms really quickly since the floor was hot.   - No option for bathing suits.  You will be naked with everyone else.  I am very near sighted so everyone looks like they've been blurred out for public television.- Be VERY careful when getting into one of the beds in the red clay ball room.  It's like walking on a hundred marbles and the floor is not forgiving.  I wiped out pretty bad and strained my MCL.  My doctor said I'll be fine in a week.  Thanks to all that laughed at me (wife included).  I am going butt in first the next time.  - The signs say to use each sauna on the 2nd floor for 3-7 minutes.  You can definitely do a little longer than that.  But one guy fell asleep in the red clay ball room (you could hear him snoring) and I am guessing he was in there for a solid hour.  He looked like a total disaster when he came out.  Stay hydrated!- I never do this but I paid $1 for the 3 minute massage chairs.  There were 2 types.  One was the standard massage which was decent and the other was the ""slimming massage chair"" which was ridiculous.  The latter just started shaking your butt from left to right, up and down like you were going through terrible airplane turbulence and it also crushed your calves.  Definitely avoid that one.I know it sounds like I am just complaining but there's a lot to like about Imperial.  The steam rooms are great.  I enjoyed sitting in the sheer heat of the herbal steam room only to jump into the cold tub as soon as I got out.  It felt so refreshing!

But, I still have a lot of nice things to say about J'Adore so let's get to it. For starters, I was able to request an appointment through the Yelp app, and someone got back to me in minutes. Major props for that. I arrived to my appointment and was happy to see that the salon looked just as nice in person as it does in photos. I picked out my colors and was led over to a pedicure chair, where I opted for rose petals (over lavender) in my soaking water. The chair, I felt, was a little uncomfortable. The woman doing my pedicure got to work while another woman came over to give me my gel soak-off. Or so I thought. After my gels were off, she went right into the manicure. So I had my mani and pedi going at the same time. I can see how this might be a benefit for someone who needed to get in and out, but I felt like I couldn't relax and enjoy!Right away, I noticed that the polish for my hands looked a little thick, but the mani proceeded. When my services were over, I gave at least 20 minutes of drying time before heading out. I received 5% off with the Check-In Offer, which was great as services are pricey. By the time I got back to my hotel room, I realized one of my nails already looked a little smudged. Within 48 hours, nearly all of my nails were chipped. My manicures at my usual salon typically last at least five days so to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. On the other hand, my pedicure is doing much better. Maybe I picked the wrong polish or it was an off day, but I wasn't super happy with my experience overall. Mostly because the results of my mani were so poor. Three days later, I've already removed the polish because my nails looked so bad.

Sister was able to get immediate pedicure and manicure services, while I had to wait about 20 minutes before Minh could give me a gel manicure.  I originally chose ""Partly Cloudy,"" which was a frosted medium-green, reminiscent of green ocean water with grey-colored reefs underneath, but Minh opined it to be too light of a color, so I went with a mood-changing color by Reaction (green/cold, blue/hot, and two-tone as the temps switch). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/signature-nail-spa-charlotte?select=PH7R5QsM9q2DU23Iu1ARIQ#PH7R5QsM9q2DU23Iu1ARIQ  We had problems trying to find a complementary lighter-colored frost polish to off-set the darker color, and Minh was gracious enough to wipe the polish off and start over.  The only downside to this is that I had to wait till he had a few minutes' break from another customer as she went to rinse her hands in between cleaning and pre-treating her acrylic nails and applying polish.

I arrived around 10:30 for my 10:45 appointment.  Fortunately, I was being dropped off because parking is a challenge - there aren't a lot of spots and several are awkwardly positioned perpendicular and close to the main road.When I checked in, they were dealing with at least 2 other wedding parties, and there was quite the noisy conversation to make sure they knew who I was and I knew where to be.

She spun me around to work, explaining that during the week they never have to be next to each other, but Saturdays are jam packed for weddings.  She did a great job!  The do was beautiful, and the bobby pins were so secure that it only took one adjustment 8 hours later after an hour of dancing to keep it looking fresh.The few downsides I noticed - there is only 1 bathroom, so the line gets long on Saturdays.  The woman doing makeup was taking time to make it perfect, and consequently, those appointments were way behind schedule.

The major downside of dry shampoo is that it's not conducive to flying:  dry shampoo is an aerosol powder, and pressure changes associated with flying in an airplane ruin the product the majority of the time.  Thus, if I'm flying somewhere and staying for more than a couple days I hunt down a place to buy Big Sexy Hair Dry Shampoo.  Enter Ulta.Stopped by this Ulta location while in town a couple weeks ago to score some dry shampoo.  Was interested in a travel size version of the stuff, but an Ulta employee informed me that the only small cans of dry shampoo in the store were Oscar Blandi brand.  Alright, I'm down to try new things.  The employee explained that the Oscar Blandi product specifically for brunettes is great because it doesn't create the fine white film associated with most dry shampoo brands (true) and adds serious volume (not true at all).  I paid $11 for the little can of Oscar Blandi product but in hindsight would gladly have paid $16.95 for the full-size Sexy Hair dry shampoo that I love so dearly.

Her choice of CC Salon & Spa--though neither she nor I had been there before Friday--was a good one.My first pedicure ever, by the way.I'm in love with the results of my pedicure and the nude-colored OPI polish (""Tickle My France-y"" or some similar silly name) I chose.  During portions of my life I've been a gymnast, dancer, runner, weightlifter, and hiker.  In other words, my toes/feet/nails have pretty much always taken a beating and have never looked nearly as good as they do now.  The pedicure my friend and I received included exfoliation and massaging, but the focus was definitely on the toenails and cuticles.  Every aspect of our pedicure was relaxing and produced nice results.  Jenn did our pedicures.  She was great and seamlessly switched back and forth between me and my friend while my friend and I sat side by side.  We were in the comfortable pedicure chairs for nearly 2 hours, so my guess is that the standard Pedicure at CC Salon & Spa lasts between 45 and 60 minutes.  (Also available are the Express Pedicure for $35 and the Spa Pedicure for $55.)  The pre-gratuity price of the standard Pedicure is $45 and increases to about $50 after tax is figured in.Sanitation seemed in line with what is required at such an establishment.  The used soaking water was drained in our presence, and I also witnessed the sanitization of the various metal tools that had been in contact with our feet.CC Salon & Spa is located within a business complex of tidy little buildings that resemble houses.

The thought of a huge, self-serve makeup and beauty shop honestly sounds like hell on wheels to me. It already takes me longer than your average human to make a decision, but wandering around a place like Ulta or Sephora--walls lined with shades of make-up only slightly different than the ones around it, eyes glazed over... no thank you. I grew up visiting beauty counters at the department stores with my Mom. She'd always take me along with her and let me get my makeup done at Clinique or Chanel. But these days I wouldn't dream about buying anything other than eye shadows and longer-lasting makeup items from those places. It's just too expensive. But I still crave that 1-on-1 service of a professional who knows his/her craft and can help me help myself. Because even if you're buying cheaper makeup, you can waste your time and money on the wrong purchases. You're still not going to get that 1:1 experience with the expertise I'm talking about at stores like Ulta, but at this particular location I got great service. I was asked if I needed help and she even checked the back for me! She also got me involved in the rewards program. I loved that I didn't have to drive out of my way to come here or go inside a mall like I've had to with Sephora. I also appreciated their vast selection of NYX products that are super-reasonably priced. Like I said, I don't mind investing in some lasting products from more expensive stores, but for my everyday makeup, Chanel and likewise really isn't in my budget. NYX is also great for trendy colors you know you won't be sporting past this season. One thing I really don't like about huge makeup places like this quality control. Because Ulta is so huge with so many nooks and crannies, I found myself unable to buy over 6 items I wanted because they had been opened already. They checked the back, too. But someone felt the need to open the last of 6 different kinds of products to try them. I'm not talking about testers here... I'm talking about people who just open anything they want to try and then put it back, without any regard for others. With a store this big, Ulta suffers from this problem A LOT. And it's gross. I think if they were better staffed and made an effort to be sure testers were readily available, this wouldn't happen as much. The last time I was there hoards of teenage girls were running around opening products and no one said a word. Lastly, like a few other Yelpers have eluded to, the inventory at Ulta is so vast that there's no way every staff member can be an expert at all the lines of products. While some Yelpers find this OK, I only find this acceptable if I'm coming for makeup I've already tried. This is why I do NOT come to Ulta to discover new products, but only to pick up what I know I love.",5,FrQ-ibgyStNevDtit9WT0w,1,OlvQpnWiAUNP98AVOGQqzg,4/6/2015,3,2,49,3181 Westgate,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}, 'BikeParking': True, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Shopping', 'Beauty & Spas', 'Cosmetics & Beauty Supply', 'Hair Salons', 'Skin Care']",Fairview Park,"{'Monday': '10:00-21:00', 'Tuesday': '10:00-21:00', 'Friday': '10:00-21:00', 'Wednesday': '10:00-21:00', 'Thursday': '10:00-21:00', 'Sunday': '11:00-18:00', 'Saturday': '10:00-21:00'}",1,41.46052,-81.8498488,Ulta Beauty,,44126,25,3.5,OH,Beauty & Spa,Ohio,Cara

John is the man to go to here, period. I've been around salons since I was little. I like to think that I know a little bit about stlists, and this guy just rocks. I'm sure if he ever left that we'd follow him to whatever local salon he chose to work. He truly puts a lot of time and attention into his cuts and styles. I've only witnessed his expertise with mens and boys cuts, but watching his work makes me think he's great with the ladies styles, too. The little guy has really, really thick, straight hair. It can get really heavy on him, floppy and almost a little anime-ish. He's never liked getting his hair cut and went through a phase where he just wanted it long and in his eyes. But recently I feel like John slowly worked with him out of that icky style and really helped him figure out what look was really him. This past time we left the salon and the little guy said it was the best haircut ever and he really liked his hair. I've never, ever heard him say this--and he was right, it really was the cutest cut I've seen on him. John even convinced him that just a little bit of product in his hair was OK and now he's interested in styling  it. So cute!My guy has thinner hair and doesn't like his hairline. We both told John exactly what he didn't like about his grown out style and he just got to work. Long story short, the haircut was exactly what my man had in mind and he looked delicious.

She is now my go-to gal for all things hair and she should be your's, too! Well, that is if you appreciate great hair and talent! I'm OBSESSED with pumped up color, cut--everything. My hair looks much healthier, happier and it's so wonderful to know that I'm in great hands with Mandy. We chatted the whole time non-stop and it feels like all the hair planets have aligned again! I cannot recommend her enough. One suggestion? Make your appointment a couple of weeks in advance! I know guys are used to just springing on a hair appointment last minute, but most gals will tell you to get an appointment with someone really talented--some advance notice is required. This isn't Best Cuts, mmmkay? IF you're a guy, it might still be easy for you to get a last minute booking, but ladies--if you're looking for color, please give your stylists the same respect you'd want--give them some notice and call in advance! I make my next appointment when I pay at the counter. You can always reschedule it.

Period. My sister, although ultimately happy with the result, had her nails redone about 4 times. The girl who was helping her did everything she could to make sure that when my sister left, her gel mani was right, but still... poor form. 2) When I came in I told them the design I wanted on my nails, they told me they could do it. They couldn't. In fact, they have one girl there who can do nail art the way it's supposed to be done. That's it. And she wasn't there. My gal ( I will not share her name because I don't want her connected to a so-so review. She's great!) just couldn't get the help and support she needed. She could do some nail art, but there was NO ONE there to help her with what she couldn't do. She tried two different methods to get my nails done and just couldn't get it. I felt awful for her--but I also was getting really upset. By the time we left we had been there about 3.5 hours. That's WAY tooo long. I had things to do and I had not planned on more than 1.5hrs, which is more than enough for your standard pedi and gel mani. 3) I also watched them turning away multiple walk-in clients when their signage outside clearly stated ""walk-ins welcome."" That could seem like a positive to some, but to me I saw two customers leaving with a horrible taste in their mouths... it was visible on their faces. If I were the business owner, I WOULD NEVER want any employee of mine to treat a potential customer that way. There are so many ways to remedy that situation. But if I were a business owner, I'd offer any walk-in client who couldn't be served anytime that day a discount on their next service. But that's just me. Now on to the positives, which there are plenty. The space itself is large and very clean. Each pedicure station looked freshly cleaned--all with signage assuring you so. Their gel nail color selection is one of the best and most updated I've seen around. You'll have a hard time choosing most certainly. They have a simple and moderately priced pedicure, but be careful what you say ""yes"" to as it will add extra charges. They have varying scented lotions you can pick from for your pedicures and the pedi's themselves look great. My gel manicure, although not entirely what I wanted, was a well-done manicure-- and my sister's was too, after 4 tries.",7,LTBRnX4iYJ494dlCTDT5dg,1,a_2K4CodSDxaBuvWKFno-A,8/23/2014,3,0,27,5082 Great Northern Plz,"{'BusinessParking': {'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}, 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': True, 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': 2, 'BikeParking': False, 'GoodForKids': False, 'ByAppointmentOnly': False}","['Hair Salons', 'Day Spas', 'Nail Salons', 'Beauty & Spas']",North Olmsted,"{'Monday': '10:00-20:00', 'Tuesday': '10:00-20:00', 'Friday': '10:00-20:00', 'Wednesday': '10:00-20:00', 'Thursday': '10:00-20:00', 'Sunday': '10:00-17:00', 'Saturday': '9:00-18:00'}",1,41.416894,-81.913734,LUV Salon & Spa,,44070,21,2,OH,Beauty & Spa,Ohio,Cara

But not at Liz Nails! This place was not only recommended by the Yelp community, but also from my gal friends on facey-space. So I gave them a try on a Monday afternoon... when I was in a mad rush... right before I left for a trip. Yep, I did that to myself. But the Liz Nails folks handled it perfectly. I stepped in the same time as another lady looking for the same gel mani/pedi service. I mentioned I was in a big hurry and without a minute passing the had invited both this lady and I to the back to get our pedicures started. Without skimping on service, the gentleman helping me got me through a great pedicure without delay. In fact, the longest part of the whole process was picking out the damn nail color. Then my first gel manicure was a great experience! It went quickly and has lasted well over a week at this point. He did it perfectly and I can't wait to come back to get my next manicure. One thing I think that could be improved on is the color selection. It's not that they don't have a lot of colors, but normally when I've gone to nail salons they have displays out with new, relevant and seasonal color lines. This is helpful to those of  us who don't get our nails done often and are really indecisive. I think I'll just come in better prepared next time. The price was around what I remember when I used to get my nails done more often. I think next time I""ll just get my toe nails painted (not a full pedi) when I get my gel manicure.

It's a great example of and shout out to their customer service and talent. In the past few weeks, Riya's has become harder and harder to get appointments within the week you call. I came back from a 10-day vacation with two missing nails from my acrylic set. For my ladies who know, missing nails make you feel like a hot mess, no matter how fancy you dress yourself up. So, I called Riya's and they couldn't get me in for TWO WEEKS! In an act of desperation, I used the Yelp app to find another place to get my nails done. The reviews were mostly about pedicures and gel manis, which should have been my first flag. Acrylic nails aren't easy. But I took a chance, brought an exact photo (from Riya's) of what I wanted and hoped for the best.Welp, that was a mistake. I walked away with animal claws. My boyfriend's reaction word was, ""gross"" and I'm out $45 for a crappy result. In another act of desperation, I walked in to Riya's the next day to see if they could squeeze me in to fix what the other salon had done.

I finally searched Yelp for ""brandy hair"" and Hairsmith popped up. Apparently, she's been here, operating her own place for a year!

I don't know why not everywhere offers this service. I do wish that it sent a calendar event so it would appear in my Google Calendar. Perhaps in the future.Regarding the haircut - I explained what I was kind of going for, and she listened, paid close attention to the shape of my head, the directions my hair grows, assessed potential issues with the cut ahead of time, was vocal about her plan and precisely what she was going to do, and what she was doing while she was cutting. She's detailed, but efficient about it. Her training was  clearly excellent (I've had consistently good cuts from stylists who studied at Toni & Guy) and she seems to take pride in her work.

There's a bit of confusion as to what door is the entrance, and they seem utterly confused and not set up for people taking the stairs up instead of the elevator. Some signage in the stairwells would help.I went to two stylists here - Sharon and LaVerne. Both seemed quite competent, but my frustrations primarily come with timeliness of this place. I think I came here 3 or 4 times. None of the times did my appointment start within 15 minutes of when it was supposed to. With Sharon, I was always double-booked while she was doing a coloring of another client's hair, so I usually ended up with an assistant washing my hair, waiting, and then getting my hair cut while the other client was waiting for color to set, and they continued their conversation. It is kind of awkward, and feels like you're not getting 100% attention from the stylist.Sharon is extremely meticulous in her work, making sure there is not a stray hair out of place, following the grain of my hair, and taking great care to make everything even. If I were getting married or going to appear on TV, I'd probably want this level of care. But, when it's a random Tuesday and I'm trying to meet up for dinner with friends, or make it back to work without spending 2 hours at the salon - it is a bit overkill.One time when I was in dire need of a cut, and Sharon wasn't available, I went to LaVerne. LaVerne did a good job, but my cut didn't quite turn out how I wanted - and was quite a bit shorter than I was going for. I'd try going to her again, though.I'm not completely against this place because there's a lot to like, but I'm not totally in love with it, either, as I've had better.

Relaxing? Maybe.. for... parts of it. Effective? Deep tissue? Absolutely.Mary figured out exactly what was wrong with my back without me even telling her that my shoulders/back hurt. She could just tell from feeling it. The combination of ashiatsu, deep tissue, Swedish, Thai, hot stone, and Chinese massages was wonderful. I left feeling aligned, loosened, and overall just great. She put a ton of work and muscle into kneading the knots out of my back, legs, etc. Prices are very reasonable. 60 minutes was $60 at the time of this writing. And, it was *actually* 60 full minutes, not like a 50-minute hour. Most places are far more expensive or require some shady contract.There were a few downsides, but none enough to lose a star for me:1) Its cash-only. They didn't warn me, so I had to go get some cash from an ATM afterwards.2) The table was a bit short for me. But, I'm a pretty tall guy. The face cutout was also a little tiny for my head - squishing my nose a bit. I'd prefer a different table.3) As others mentioned, there is a bit of a different attitude towards modesty. I opted to completely disrobe, as I've found most therapists can do a much better job on the glutes (and after doing squats, lunges, deadlifts, rowing, skiing, biking, running, etc I need them to do a good job) with no clothing in the way. Ultimately, I was glad I made that decision, as she was indeed able to massage the hell out of my butt muscles and lower back without obstruction. I was covered in a towel which was displaced as necessary, but it most certainly wasn't always covering all the manbits at all times. Oh well. At the end of the day, I completely didn't care, though, because she was absolutely professional about it and I was in such a state of zen muscular submission that the towel wasn't even necessary. I could see this may bother others, though, so keep that in mind.4) I called ahead to make an appointment, but I don't think they actually took my name.

I forgot ask but she's thorough, attentive, prompt with her start time and also executed my back facial.  I found this place via Groupon. And I am glad because it was a good find I purchased a massage back facial and a facial. Candice took care of the massage and back facial with very good detail to her work and when the pressure was a bit much for me as only twice but she had just it accurately actually superbly. Now she start as soon as I walked in and I must admit I was a bit caught off guard no one had me complete any paperwork but I'm more appreciative that we started immediately and I arrived ten minutes before my appointment to complete paperwork.I was told for the facial that I was just a basic facial with the Groupon so it would not include a mask and extractions I upgraded or another $40 which is a bit pricey and I don't have to have it again. The owner completed my facial and she was nice enough.  The place and Decor is very aesthetically pleasing.  Water is offered in a wine glass and the robes are provided as you go between the rooms; however, the owner could stand to replace the sheets. As the sheets on the table for the facial room or estheticians room wasn't dirty but you could tell they had been stained.Anywho, I had every intention on giving five stars after getting my massage but that facial left a lot to be desired she was throwing her extractions but literally I think the group hunt yeah the group was $100 then another 40 to upgrade the face show I feel like it was a Hustle and with that being said I've had better facials I mean kneaded relief is great. Nonetheless; I will give kudos for the extractions on my face so that was done very well. I had to hold my mask longer than the five minutes I was initially told (she left me for 15m) this would not have been a big deal had I not needed to make a trip to Rock Hill and return to work.All in all the prices have increased because there's a manual change on the menu but I will return for services from Candace as again...I  applaud her effort, her pressure, her professionalism and her bedside manner. Also, she does a great job stretching the neck and I usually have to find people to do that. She did it without me saying a word about it.

All of our places that we had been too previously were on the other side of town so it was a matter of finding something closer to home.  After reviewing multiple reviews on Yelp and looking at pricing of different places, we finally decided on Sanctuary Massage.We knew we wanted a Saturday or Sunday (yes they have Sunday appointments!!) appointment with two females so I called in to book.   It took a little while to find something available, I believe we had a month and half to two month wait before we could get something scheduled.  It was worth the wait!Kevin had Irma giving him his massage and I had Pam giving me my massage.  Kevin thought that was the best massage he has had yet!!  I would rank mine right up there as well.  I really enjoyed it because it was a true full body message and they gave us a full 60 minute message, not cheating us out of 5 minutes to relax and get changed!  We both thought our therapists gave the right intensity at the right time.I think my only complaint...very small one...is that the rooms are not on the interior of the building like at other places I have been to.  While they have room darkening curtains, that doesn't stop you from hearing outside noises.  They are in a relatively quiet business park (especially for a Sunday), but I did hear a car horn at one point.The messages were so great that we booked to go back later in the year.

Had I had another hair stylist, this could have possibly been another 4 star review.  My review with Jewell still stands, but my experience yesterday needs to be mentioned.  Most of my 1 star reviews are because of bad customer service, and this is no different.I walked in and was told it was a 30-40 minute wait.  I decided to wait it out, it actually did not take that long to wait, but here is my issue...  There were only two stylist working and they were super busy after the work day was over for most people.  I had just watched them finish with 3-4 people and there were still three people waiting at the store and three people had just signed in online, so you knew it was going to be continuously busy.  At that time, one of the hair stylist went out back.  One of the guys that checked in online came in and asked if there was just one stylist there.  The other stylist said ""there is another one here but she went out back, not sure why she went out back, but she did.""  Not only did this one stylist make it look bad for Great Clips to go take a smoke break when you have essentially 6 people waiting, but she also made it bad for her coworker to have to give an excuse to incoming customers about her break.  Just great, I was the next in line for this person because the other two in front of me wanted to wait for the other stylist.  I could have done the same, but I decided to go ahead with her.  Of course after having a smoke break, she reeked of smoke.  Not everyone appreciates that smell or wants your smoke hands to be working with their hair.There is a time and place for smoke breaks, but not when you have six people waiting and have a haircut to do immediately after.Aside from all of that, my haircut was pretty good, but she did not really like it when I wanted to cut my hair a little bit more than originally requested.

I stopped in around noon on a Friday for a polish change since I thought that would be an easy, less intense way to check it out than a manicure or pedicure.Blue Sky is on the far end of a strip mall-ish facility, so the inside definitely felt very sterile to me (and not sterile like you want a nail salon to feel); the walls were white, the floor was tile, there was nothing on the walls, and there was no TV. It looked like they were planning to install one, so maybe they're still getting their decor down. However, it did seem very clean, and I saw a couple of rooms that were used for waxing. But I digress!When I walked in, I told the two women behind the front desk that I needed a polish change. They asked hands or toes; I said hands, and that was the last time anyone spoke to me in English. They appeared to have a gel bar, which was pretty cool, but I'm a basic polish girl, so I I started looking for a color. Their selection was a seriously limited for natural/nude colors. They had OPI and another brand I didn't recognize, and the first color I picked looked like White Out on my nails. The technician nicely let me change and came up to the wall to help me pick. I wound up going with Bubble Bath - the only nude-ish color they had - which still isn't my favorite, but I wasn't sure how to leave halfway into a service.The technician was nice enough, and I appreciated that she filed and buffed my nails and used cuticle oil since some other places literally just change your polish on a polish change.When I left, there were two different women at the front desk/cash register. Neither of them spoke to me - they spoke to each other, trying to figure out their computer system and how much I owed them. There's a huge menu on the wall, so I pointed at it and said, ""It looks like I owe $8, right?"" The woman nodded and opened the cash register. I gave her a $20 and asked for $10 back, which she silently gave me, and I walked out.Maybe they're still trying to get their feet under them and learn their systems, but customer service was pretty crummy and the ambiance leaves a little to be desired. There were a couple of other women getting pedicures/manicures, and one of them had wine (perk!) and the other was having all kinds of conversation with her technician, so maybe my experience was a one-off?",4,0VaKFCTaN5y_yPTtj9iNYw,1,f2kDxs69Ivbu7qkBZWW8SA,6/30/2017,3,0,28,"2764 Pleasant Rd, Ste 101",{},"['Beauty & Spas', 'Nail Salons', 'Waxing', 'Hair Removal']",Fort Mill,"{'Monday': '9:30-19:00', 'Tuesday': '9:30-19:00', 'Friday': '9:30-19:00', 'Wednesday': '9:30-19:00', 'Thursday': '9:30-19:00', 'Saturday': '9:30-19:00'}",1,35.0602184,-80.96431,Blue Sky Nail Bar,,29708,7,3.5,SC,Beauty & Spa,South Carolina,Kellie

Parking is a little tricky, but I went during lunch on a Friday, so it wasn't too hard to find a spot, and the place wasn't too busy.When I walked in, I was promptly greeted, and the man behind the counter asked what service I needed and if I wanted something to drink. I went with the Express Pedicure ($25) and a water, and when I asked about picking a color, he brought a basket over to me. Ok, y'all, I'm admittedly old school (and just old), but I like perusing the wall of bottles, flipping them over to see the name, and holding onto a couple before I make my final decision. Lacquer Lounge has a basket full of plastic nails painted in colors with a number on the back; you pick the color you like and I assume they match it up based on the number (gel or regular). This OCD lady had a bit of a panic moment - do they have OPI Koala Berry? what if I accidentally pick OPI Red because it looks good on the nail but definitely not on my pale, translucent skin? Thankfully, he saw my panic and asked what colors I usually get. I blurted out OPI Cajun Shrimp, and they had it. Phew.The rest of the pedicure was much less neurotic than the beginning. The woman who did it was incredibly nice and engaging when I wanted to talk but didn't force me to talk, which I appreciated. The Express Pedicure is definitely quick - I was in an out in less than 30 minutes - and not a bad price but still gives you the hot towel, shaping, and callus/cuticle removal. The place itself is spotless and brand new with air dryers built into the manicure stands and the massage controller built into the armrest on the pedicure chairs - fancy! According to their menu of services, they also do waxing, eyelash extensions, relaxation facial masks, and reflexology foot massages.

Since I have dark hair, it took me two appointments to bleach and tone my hair to the color I wanted, and Jessica even stayed way after the salon closed on the second appointment to finish my hair.
