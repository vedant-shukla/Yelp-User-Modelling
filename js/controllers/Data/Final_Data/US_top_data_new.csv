I also found out they offer full-service catering. The hostesses were friendly (they put up with me) and knowledgeable.The place eventually became crowded. It was somewhat hilarious (and a little offensive) how one kid was watching a DVD at the table (who brings their kid - and their personal player - to a place like Rosemary's?). It was all the more obvious since the room was dim (relatively speaking: the tables in the front bar area were better lit). Our dining room suffered from ""mood lighting"" and would benefit from seat or table spotlights; I like to see what I'm eating. Others may argue that they don't want to see their date, so this place may be good for you!Service was outstanding. Our primary server and his assistant explained every dish (even the beer selections). Like Perrier's Le Bec-Fin, the servers were enthusiastic and placed the dishes on the table in unison. Unlike LBF, the servers didn't buzz around the table like insects.I was running on an hour of sleep, so I (wisely) refrained from having alcohol but a friend had the beer-meal pairings, which he enjoyed.A few of us ordered the chef's tasting menu ($70). Compared to typical tasting menus, the overall package was a generous size and we weren't able to finish it all. The courses which grabbed my attention (even through my sleepy stupor) were:- l'amuse bouche (I was amused)- First course: salmon tartar appetizer with watercress, caviar, crackers and a saffron sauce- Fourth course: rack of lamb with Kalamata olive mashed potatoes, fried arugula, and a rosemary bordelaise sauce (mmmmmm - quite savory and the lamb was oh-so-tender)Lackluster courses:- Second course: Panko crab boulettes with marinated cucumbers (flavorless)- Third course: Crispy skin striped bass with hushpuppies and a creole meuniere sauce (not too much flavor, and not a fan of fish)- Dessert: I don't remember the dessert - not my thing anyway.Rosemary's is 30-40 minutes from the Strip, but worth the cab ride there.

Wish I had some right now.- I'm an oyster junkie, so I had to get their oysters ($3/oyster; East, West, and Speciality oysters available) were fresh and delicious.- The Forks ($21) were a little cheesy (in both senses of the word) - smoked salmon, caviar poppers, scallion blinis. My least favorite, but still tasty.I'd stop in again for the sliders, and perhaps their entrees (my one friend enjoyed his 20 oz. Ribeye ($49), and I trust his opinion).

You're CRAZY!!!That actually may be a true statement about me, since my mother has never had me tested! But nevertheless, I did not enjoy the charred, ashy flavor of their meats (particularly the ribeye steak sandwich). I didn't add any additional toppings (which might have helped), but I wanted to taste the purity of the meat. Also, the ratio of meat to veggies was ridiculously lopsided with thick cut roasted veggies being probably 70% of the sandwich. Considering the cost of the sandwich, I would have expected more meat.  Although I liked the burger much more, I was not a fan of the hard breads they use to compliment their sandwiches. I also did not enjoy the strong flavor of the roasted potatoes and the beef empanadas were just okay. My tweenage kids took a bite and refused to eat any more of their food. They have a serious dislike for anything that has a burnt flavor and I honestly couldn't argue with them. I love a decent char, but today it was like eating cigarette butts from an ashtray. I felt so bad because I really hyped this place up to them after reading reviews and getting recommendations prior to my visit. So I took them down the street for a bowl of pho to make amends.

My kids hated the super charred flavor of their burgers and rib eye steak sandwich, so I had to quickly find an alternative eating venue to satisfy their teenage hunger. Although Gauchos is Pittsburgh's highest rated restaurant, I must admit I was not a fan, but I was not nearly as disgusted as my kids.  We ate a few bites there and decided to give Vietnam's Pho a try since we'd parked practically right in front of it anyway. Yelp reviews had the overall rating here @ 3.5 stars, so I figured I wouldn't be too disappointed. However, the lack of customers and weirdly abandoned looking entrance made me pause. The entrance looks like the lobby of an old apartment building. You then walk through more doors into another space that serves as their to-go sandwich shop before walking through yet another door into the main dining area. It was dark and totally weird with a fish tank dead smack in the middle of the room, but we were hungry and decided to give it a try anyway. So glad we did!The pho came out piping hot in a nice size bowl. I was immediately impressed that I barely saw any oil droplets on the surface. This is either an indication that they don't cook their broth using beef bones/stock or they meticulously skim the surface to give you the cleanest broth experience possible.

Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time.

We rushed over to our concierge for advice.Probably the most on-point concierge ever, Angie asked us about our time constraints, how far we wanted to travel - and recommended grabbing a spot at the bar at Okada.Some of the best advice we received that whole weekend.Okada was a swank, well lit, and beautiful space. It's easily a destination spot.  As soon as we arrived, we let our waitress know we were in a rush, and she seated us right away at the bar - right in front of the sushi chef. Within a couple of seconds - we had water, our menus, and were ready to order.We ended up ordering the spicy scallop, yellowtail, tuna, shrimp tempura and eel & cucumber rolls to shareConnie also ordered an amazingly fruity and light sparkling sake.Everything came out quickly and each roll was fresh and perfectly made.At the end of the night, one of the roaming managers took it upon himself to pour us the last drops of the sake into our empty glasses. Unfortunately mine overflowed onto the table. Not a big deal at all. But within a minute or two - the manager returned with a new bottle on the house.Now that's service!Glammed up, with delicious sushi coating my Spanxed stomach, and time to spare before the show I was glad that we didn't make a made dash over to Koi.Despite our limited time, Okada excelled in taste, service, and atmosphere.",16,18,1P3OUpIvnop4BsgsztDEWQ,5/2/2008,5,12,30,Restaurant

I got to spend last weekend here in honor of the infamous Gabi K's (ahem, I mean Gabi M) wedding. And this gorgeous hotel is quite fitting for the wedding of a Yelp ""celebrity.""  My husband and I checked in late on a Friday night and the only rooms left were suites....and so we were upgraded to a magnificent suite overlooking the adult pool and Camelback Mountain.  I know, you're feeling real sorry for us right now. ;)  Our suite was HUGE with a separate living room, bathroom fit for a queen, a balcony the size of my bedroom back home, and 2 flat screen TVS.  After some fiddling with the TV we discovered they had tivo, which meant my husband could tivo the Northwestern game while we enjoyed hiking Camelback the next morning. Phew- the weather was too nice to stay inside watching TV!The resort was just as heavenly outside of our suite: an adult pool, a noisy pool for those of you with kiddies, delicious food, incredible workout facility including spinning classes, and a $32 million dollar spa.  I had thought about booking a couples massage before my trip, but my husband suggested we hold off since we've been going thru lots of dough lately. . After one look at the spa he asked me when we'd be indulging in our couples massage and I reminded him of our plan to save money.  His response ""when have you ever listened to me in the past?"" Next time I'll definitely be booking that massage, although this time I did get to enjoy a blissful shower in the spa. Gabi's wedding was absolutely perfect.  The ceremony took place on the Valencia lawn with a breathtaking view of the mountain and then we moved inside the Valencia ballroom for dinner and dancing.  The neutral colored ballroom looked lovely with the beautiful fall colored flowers Gabi chose.The suite, facilities, and wedding were worthy of a 5 star review. So why the 4 stars? The resort seemed to be a bit short staffed over the weekend and the service at the pool, restaurant and throughout the resort was very slllloooowwww.   Wait 30 minutes for an Arnold Palmer slow.

We followed his lead and took our seats at the table...and soon were greeted by a friendly waiter.  Thank goodness because after a long plane trip from Florida to Arizona I was starving!!  I soon had lots of food to alleviate the pains of hunger. We started with NoRTH's infamous zucca chips for the table, as well as a pizza.  The zucca chips were fabulous- a must while dining at NoRTH! As for my entree I ordered the scallops, which came on top of orzo.  Our waiter suggested I also add a few shrimps to the dish as well, which didn't turn out to be such a great idea because the shrimp was way overcooked. I can eat shrimp for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but these were inedible! The scallops, on the other hands, were cooked to perfection and the orzo was pretty tasty as well.  We also ordered a side of organic veggies.  I'm not usually a veggie lover, but if veggies were always this good I'd be eating them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner instead of the shrimp!I wasn't blown away by the service and/or the food, but the wine list did look very inviting so I'd be willing to go back for a drink when back in Phoenix.",1,2,UXIfnaDS6nQfoZaFLKwWug,5/11/2008,3,1,23,Restaurant

In addition to smiling 20-somethings with Adonis DNA, the food was also pretty interesting and had options for just about every type of eater (carnivorous, health conscious, vegan, et al.). Because I've been on a bit of a plant kick as of late, I went with the Vigan (very clever working in the name of the establishment with the sandwich itself), and while I did have to ask to remove the Mozzarella cheese to make it a truly vegan entree, the sauteed portabella mushrooms, squash, red peppers and caramelized onions sandwiched between soft, rectangular focaccia with a side of onion rings was enough to leave me satisfied while wading in unknown dining waters. They also featured a pretty impressive 5-spice edamame appetizer, but their guacamole left a little to be desired. I take my whipped avocado seriously being that I hail from the avocado capital of the world, and while it's much like pizza in that even bad guacamole is still pretty good, it certainly fell somewhere towards the bottom end of the bland spectrum.On a nice night in Phoenix, something I experience very, very rarely in San Francisco, I can't imagine there are many better places that offer up a sprawling patio like theirs to soak up a warm evening in the city.

First of all, Chef James Porter is a rock star in the culinary scene in Scottsdale. He really walks the walk and talks the talk, and not because he's some up-and-coming kitchen punk with a sleeve of tattoos trying to become the next Food Network sensation, but because he's really good at what he does. If you consider yourself a foodie, he'll go toe-to-toe with you any time, and likely, he'll make you feel like a novice. With that being said, he's a pleasant guy to be around, and if you ever have a chance to share a beer with him at the bar, I highly recommend you take the time for a brief txc3xaate-xc3xa0-txc3xaate. He's quite the engaging fellow!Intriguing discourse aside, Petite Maison will leave any fan of French fare in Arizona with sense of fulfillment aprxc3xa9s fete. With an urbane, yet simple menu on their hands, their daily grit will touch on just about every aspect of what makes French dining so enjoyable. Small bites like escargots and piquant fromage dot the carte du jour, while staples like coq au vin and steak frites round out the dinner menu. Not an overly robust selection to choose from, but just the right amount to raise the eyebrows of any eater. They'll also cater to anyone with dietary restrictions (exempli gratia: vegan diners) by whipping up any assortment of seasonal, off-menu vegetable selections. In addition to the cuisine, they have a nice bar program in place with a handful of prohibition era cocktails, and a fun late night menu complete with a $5 ""red cup"" sangria chock full of fresh fruit, bathed in a crisp, sugary chardonnay. It's a steal for the taste and refreshment, and a perfect nightcap before ending the night in Scottsdale. All in all, this proved to be quite the unexpected gem in a swath of muted colors and cacti as far as the eye can see. If anyone plans on catching Giants spring training, their facility is literally 4 blocks away from Petite Maison!

A mile high mountain of carne asada beef, salsa, cheese, and crema over fries is terrible for anyone's diet but delicious nonetheless.

Dated interior with a homey feel, this unassuming spot has family vibes written all over it. Popular during lunch time but a real casual option in the evening, this place gets better and better each time I visit.Service gets major points for their willingness to please and the family of youngsters are always putting their game face on. They've been polite and welcoming since my first visit and do a good job despite the demand. Management has done well with keeping the food interesting and affordable. Ordering food can be a bit on the slow side, but they've prefaced this by noting the food is made with love.They've done well with the bulgolgi and I'm certain have created hardcore fans as a result of it. One could rock bulgolgi fries, bulgolgi burritos, or even the amazingly hearty bulgolgi torta. Go next level with the bulgolgi grilled cheese, bulgolgi tater tots or a traditional bulgolgi plate with rice and salad. With this meat, anything (delicious) is possible.For non-bulgolgi items, I have been enamored with their beef kimchi fried rice. Order a runny egg and take a deep breath when the yolk magically weaves everthing together. While I enjoy the spicy pork rice plate, I also love the pork belly musubi. Nachos with any of the aforementioned meats is highly recommended. Don't feel the need to dine in? Go for takeout, but I'd recommend calling in ahead of time.

My last go around here was a magical plate of corned beef hash with two smooth and silky eggs over easy. I ordered a side of avocado to smear onto my toast, which was glorious in itself.

Sure, I had just finished a stint on the other side of the world and was basking in the nostalgia of hashbrown glory that I was experiencing at Mr Mamas, but the food only made me think of every other time I've been here in past trips, which were all excellent.A huge shout out to the owners / management who go out of their way to make sure as customers that we feel every bit as wonderful as we did regardless of how many visits.

While the turkey club, boneless wings, and spicy tuna roll (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the seared ahi and poke stack were the surprising winners of the night. Extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert?

We noticed he was playing with the stereo system and commented on how funny it would be if he suddenly turned the volume up really loud. I perused the menu and located some of the items I wanted to try and promptly ordered.Roti canai ($3.25) is a must when eating with hubby and lil guy. The one here was outstanding.

Lil guy even ate the spicy curry sauce and it wasn't lame like the one at Satay Malaysian Grill. This one had some heat to it. I was very proud that lil guy's taste buds were so refined, and most of all refined enough to like this one over the one at Satay. He was right, this one was far better than the one at Satay.My other favorite dish is Hainan Chicken Rice ($5.75) and when it arrived I immediately dove in. WOW. The chicken was tender, the soy sauce was perfect and the accompanying chili/ginger sauce was awesome. I had to ask for more sauce it was THAT good. The chicken flavored rice was also delicious. Lil guy even liked this dish. I was very very happy.We also got the Hokkien Char Mee or Hokkien style fried noodles ($6.95) was the weakest dish of all. They used the wrong noodles.... should've been egg or 'oil' noodles in Chinese, but it tasted like they used a variation of udon noodles. It was either that or they overcooked it so the texture became mushy. Wrong texture but good flavor.Service was so-so, not bad but not outstanding. However, the meal was excellent so I was happy.

I was pretty certain they'd be open, but just to make sure I called beforehand. I tried starting at 10am but no answer.... closer to 11am they answered and indeed were open -- at 11am!We headed over there, got seated, looked at a menu and our server, a Shanghainese man, seemed quite pleased to speak my home dialect with me.They don't have salty soy milk and if you want sweet soy milk, you can add the sugar yourself. What they bring to you is a bowl of plain soy milk -- which was fine by us because we added some vinegar and soy to it and it sufficed. Not the best, but it worked.The XLB arrived right after the soymilk and immediately, I knew they wouldn't be very good. A few had pierced through so all the juicy liquid had oozed out. I picked up an XLB and put the thing in my mouth after dipping it into vinegar -- hmmmm --- the piece of meat was too dense -- definitely not good enough for me to come back just for these, but what followed turned out to be a really wonderful surprise.Potstickers arrived and after biting into one I was completely sold! These were some of the most perfect potstickers I've ever had -- crispy on the bottom and still succulent everywhere else. the wrapper wasn't too thick and the filling not too small -- it was pretty damn good!Sheng jian bao (don't know what they are called in English) are these little buns which contain pork. I've not had anything this perfect in the US. The bottom was crispy and the top had the perfect pillowy softness of the bao. Most places I've had these at would steam the bun first and then fry the buns when you order. This is the wrong way to cook these. The name 'sheng jian bao' literally means pan frying the bun from its raw format. What they do is, they fry the raw bun in a pan, add liquid, close the lid to 'steam' the bun as it cooks the filling and the top part of the bun, remove lid and wait until the bottom is dry, remove and serve. And how do I know that these were done the correct way? Well, there is a certain crust that forms on the bottom and around the bun and these ones had it. The other sign is that the bun part is like a pillow when you bite into them, not hard and dense like those you might find at dim sum where they steam the buns and then pan fry them.Definitely some of the best sheng jian baos ever!Cong you bing -- was okay, wasn't the best I've ever had, a little too greasy, but they used enough scallions so it was a plus.I saw another table had the beef roll and couldn't resist but order some. This was another dish which is done to perfection here! They are generous with the five spiced beef filling and the condiments like cilantro is ample but not too much or too little. The sweet sauce they drizzle into it is also not overtly sweet and so, enhances the flavors without making it sickly sweet.Definitely some really above average Chinese/Taiwanese breakfast foods I've tasted! This will stay on my list of places to return to whenever we're in town!4.5 stars!",9,7,a6_gFrSRX10n-60KzOjfRg,12/26/2009,4,5,56,Restaurant

No omakase was offered but they had a tasting menu for $130. Lil guy had udon with vegetables, agedashi tofu ($7) and an order of edamame ($5).First course: trio of 2 slices of toro drizzled with a yuzu soy sauce; tuna tartare with yuzu and avocado; toro tartare stack with beluga caviar and gold flakes. I was impressed with how my meal started. Everything on this plate tasted great and was beautifully presented although both the tartares kind of stuck to the plate when I tried to pick it up with my chopsticks and I ended up having to scrape it off with my chopsticks.Second course (although it should really be the 4th): duo of hamachi and kanpachi. The former consisted of a garlic soy yuzu sauce while the latter was sitting in a marinade of black truffle oil and yuzu. Again both were rather pleasing to the palate.Third course (or is it the 6th now): beef tataki of thinly sliced Kobe beef drizzled with a soy sauce infused with garlic. Paper thin slivers of fried garlic on each slice of beef were accompanied with daikon sprouts. I didn't like the taste of the beef. It just didn't taste like how raw Kobe beef should taste - strong and rather off putting. The heavy sauce managed to mask the unpleasantness of the beef and the fried garlic helped immensely so it was still palatable in the end.Satay lobster in uni butter sauce as this dish was present also came with one large scallop - slightly overcooked so it was a tad chewy. I didn't think the satay complemented the dish at all. In fact, it overpowered the delicate flavor of uni and ended up making this dish mediocre at best. Beef short rib arrived very artistically presented. It included white asparagus, edamame, caramelized pearl onion and a small sliver of foie gras atop the beef. I loved the taste of the foie gras but the beef short rib was nothing special. It was no different than good galbijim and therefore didn't impress.I have no idea why they decided to add lobster to the miso soup because it did nothing for it. The miso soup itself was watery and unflavorful and the chunks of lobster meat was bland. It's hard to believe that a high end restaurant like this couldn't present a tastier version of something as simple as miso soup.The final portion of the meal before dessert was the sushi. I thought it was excellent that they gave you fresh wasabi because it definitely enhances the sushi experience. However, I was extremely disappointed in the sushi itself. The rice was still on the al dente side and the fish was also not of superb quality. Maguro and salmon were okay - I've had far better elsewhere. The hirame (flounder) was surprisingly gristly. It was chewy and crunchy! Not very pleasant. I enjoyed the hamachi though, it was almost buttery in texture. I liked the ume which accompanied the sushi. This course was wonderfully presented (see photo).I was at the end of the meal portion and felt let down. It started off with a bang but slowly went downhill. How does this happen in an establishment such as this? Aren't the courses supposed to build into a crescendo until it explodes and then give the diner a sense of climax in the end?I guess the chef did somehow make it up with dessert because it was excellent. I being not a dessert fan had nothing but great things to say about the dessert trio which arrived. The rich chocolate ganache cake infused with sake was superb. The other two (names fail me) were also good. Both had something fruity in it so it wasn't heavy at all.If I only had the first two courses and then the final dessert, I would've given them 5 stars. I thought service could've been better. They brought me a refill of iced tea ($3) once and then forgot about it. The courses also came out a tad too quickly, often before I'd even finished the previous course. For a high-end establishment it was lacking both in service and the quality of food it was serving especially since I was paying $130 for the tasting menu. What truly rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that I ordered udon for the lil guy and the menu had shrimp tempura udon for $16. Since lil guy didn't eat shrimp I asked if they could do it with vegetables instead. The server told me sure they could but failed to inform me that I would be charged the same price. If I had known, I would've just ordered the shrimp tempura and ate it myself. In the end, I was charged $16 for plain udon with a few vegetables in it. When I questioned the server his response was ""it's not on the menu"". WTF??? This type of customer service is a reflection of poor management. Just because something is not on the menu doesn't mean you can't be flexible and offer a service to a customer when they ask for it. But after you offer that service you need to tell them that they would be charged the same amount and then let them make that decision.Ordinarily it would've been a 3 star rating but overall, they only get a 2.",6,5,Mx_C_uDFCqFP5enqawT41A,12/31/2007,2,2,50,Restaurant

It was 4pm and it was neither here nor there, but I complied.We get in there and the Shanghainese owner seated us. He was pretty funny. After finding out I could speak the language, he came over and talked and talked with us. We got the XLB since it was so cheap hoping it would be good. They also had 'ma lan tou' which is a cold appetizer (which I love). We also ordered scallion pancakes which is lil guy's favorite. Stir fried rice cake is also another favorite of our's so we got an order of that too.  I then noticed they also had salty soy bean milk which, generally is on the weekend menu of many Restaurant but here, you can get it at any time.The rice cakes was delicious, so was the ma lan tou. Lil guy loved the scallion pancakes AND the rice cakes. Hubby loved the salty soy milk. I thought the soy milk was really good.... again so surprising in Las Vegas of all places. The only thing which was not up to par to Din Tai Fung of course as the wrapper was on the thick side, but for $3.95, it was alright.To find such good Shanghainese food is one thing in the LA area, but in Vegas? I was pretty blown away. The owner was tickled pink watching hubby eat all the traditional foods commenting on it whenever he could.

I'm usually a huge fan of the Westin and although this particular location isn't as nice as the majority of them worldwide, it still has all the fixings which I love about the Westin.Check in was a breeze and friendly. It didn't take much time at all before we were all headed up to our room. I like the fact that this was a smaller hotel and that we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. The other redeeming factor was that it didn't smell like smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casino area, but since it's so small, you don't have a host of people hanging out anyway.Between 5 and 7pm, there is a complimentary happy hour for all guests. You can go down to Suede restaurant and enjoy wine, beer, snacks -- all unlimited -- for 2 hrs. We went down and got some fruit, cheese, chips and they had some pretty tasty wine available as well as various beers and soft drinks.Later, we were making tea in our room and ran out of tea bags, cups and water (they give you Nestle bottled water for free to make tea and coffee with) so we called housekeeping and within 5 mins they had brought us some more.The Heavenly bed is out of this world -- I just dozed off in the middle of the afternoon enveloped in its comfort. The shower is another plus with its signature 2 shower heads.We did have a problem with the AC as it wouldn't register any lower than 72 degrees. I had set it to 65 degrees before we left to go out for dinner and when we returned, it was the same temp. So I again called downstairs and they sent an engineer within 5 minutes. He brought us a bar of chocolate -- how awesome is that?He changed the filter and fixed the problem and was out the door in less than 10 mins. The room remained cool for the whole night. So for me, this was an awesome experience. The service was out of this world. My previous experiences with other hotels is that you can call them, but they won't arrive for at least 15-20mins. I would definitely come back again the next time we visit Vegas. I'm done with all those kitschy flashy hotels.Oh, and winning money at the casino was another huge plus!!4.5 stars!!!",18,14,qrLN56hit8NtWPITJRoi8w,5/12/2009,5,11,42,Restaurant

We didn't manage to eat here on our last trip, so this time around, we decided to try and get in there on our first night in Vegas. We didn't make a reservation and it was around 7.30pm when we got there. Even though it was a Monday night, they looked pretty packed, but then again, where isn't it packed in Vegas every single night of the week?Luckily they had a table for us. Before we even ordered, a plate of complimentary appetizers were placed on the table... olives, toasted slices of baguette and some balls of either cheese or flavored butter - I couldn't tell what it was really.Hubby ordered sangria ($6). ACK, it was awful and tasted like they used cheap wine in it. I stuck with iced tea. After we ordered, the food arrived rather quickly. Boquerones ($5) on toast was okay. The marinated anchovies weren't the best I'd ever had, but we hadn't had boquerones for a long time now so we really felt like some. Really awesome bocquerones has no trace of fishiness, but these ones did have a slight fishy taste to it.Fried calamari was also okay. It was pretty good although again a little too much batter to my liking. But it wasn't rubbery so that was a plus. The camarones al ajillo was not bad, but hubby said I could've easily made that dish at home so it wasn't anything which blew him away.The duck rolls with hoisin sauce were pretty disgusting in my book. The rolls were like egg rolls but stuffed with duck. It had WAY too much hoisin sauce making them just TOO TOO sweet. It actually made my mouth pucker from just one bite. I did not like these at all. The last tapa we ordered were the lamb chops which were served with a red wine reduction. This was clearly the star of the evening. Perfectly grilled with the sauce enhancing the lamb chops instead of throwing the entire dish off like the hoisin sauce on the duck rolls. It was served on a very flavorful bed of lentils, zucchini spaghetti strands and artichokes. I would definitely order this dish again.5 tapa, 1 glass of sangria, an iced tea and one lemonade came to slightly under $55 before tip. Kinda pricey if you ask me. Service was okay, nothing to write home about. Now that I've eaten here, I don't think I'll come back again on a future trip. There are just way too many great Restaurant in Vegas to return to Firefly. Food was mediocre, but I think if you are in Vegas partying, this place has great atmosphere and is good for downing alcohol and having a small bite to eat. However, we aren't the partying type even if lil guy wasn't in tow. All we want is awesome food at reasonable prices (or even awesome food at not so reasonable prices) and Firefly certainly doesn't fall into that category.",3,2,npYJcnNzfkTYHg19_U7vyw,8/24/2007,3,1,37,Restaurant

So one star off.---------------------------------THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. That was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. I wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. Man, it was bustling! Turns out they were open until 3am Mon-Sat, until 2.30am on Sundays. However, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.So there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. Lil guy was all for it. So, counter it was. I was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. There were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. They were obviously having a good time.We were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. Hubby left the ordering to me. I ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). Then, I proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.Uni pon ($5.50) arrived first. It was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. OMG it was fantastic. The uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. I could've eaten 3 of these.Then came the salmon skin salad ($5). This was no ordinary salmon skin salad. This was the emperor of all salmon skin salads I've ever had. Crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. Hubby and I shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel. Taramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something I've been craving since leaving Hawaii. I used to eat it at least once a week. After a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. The taramiso did not disappoint. In fact, it was so perfect hubby and I again commented on how much we've missed this dish.All the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable DVD player oblivious of all the ongoings around him. Tofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. Romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. The grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.Of course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. We had 2 large bottles of Asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). I'm sorry, but Santouka Ramen does not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. The broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. The chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. It looked like pancetta. Hubby was a bit skeptical but I assured him he would like it, and guess what? He did.This is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas, and let me tell you this, I'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, I'm not eating the food as I'm writing this.

This ain't a buffet, and how much oatmeal can one really eat, anyway!? I might just put one of these in my house. *Wonderful coffee and tea offerings served in REAL MUGS if you are hanging out. Not to mention, INTELLIGENTSIA coffee brewed and served. Be still my Chicago-loving heart. *Bright, clean, spacious, cozy: A fireplace, plenty of sturdy tables and chairs. Bright paint, wood floors, just a down home comfy feel that makes you want to sit around all day drinking great coffee, reading books and chatting with dear friends. It just makes you feel HAPPY. Well decorated. Nicely appointed. *CLEAN BATHROOMS. 'Nuff said. *Friendly staff. You'd think this would be a given at a caffeine-slinging coffee shop, but it ain't always the case. We were greeted with warm smiles and helpful suggestions. Bad ass. Big Dog. Do it. *accepts credit cards*free wifi",7,6,cisDBjj-T35MN5nZrhIX_A,12/14/2011,5,3,54,Restaurant

Also, a whole mess of sandwiches, etc. Yes, the food is excellent enough to stand on its own, but what truly makes this place shine is the service. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly, equipped with a wifi password (he saw me checking my phone, checking in of course!) without even asking, plus a story to boot (ask the owner about ""Yo Pipes!""). Waters and hot teas arrived swiftly as did menus. Our lunching partners joined us, we all ordered and from start to finish the service was utterly flawless. We had no less than 3 gentlemen taking orders, delivering food, refilling waters, checking on our happiness, etc. All just seemed to totally have their shit together and like being alive. This is rarity in the biz, these guys got it. This place has roots, and one of them seems to be treating guests like proper guestsAnd making them wish they'd worn stretchy pants. On a last second whim, I went with the full English Breakfast. Baked beans, bangers (sausages), 2 eggs over easy and thick cut toast all heaped onto a plate. It arrived in all of its glory, HOT, delicious and exactly what I wanted. It kept me full for approximately 9 hours (the entire drive to NYC) and I consumed about 1/4 of it. This stuff is for REAL. I'd say you might want to think about sharing plates due to the huge portions, but the food is so darned good I just recommend ordering your own and taking home leftovers. It's worth it.

I have some serious personal issues with spending as much as I did on Chinese food for 2.  I just imagine my Taiwanese mother looking at this menu and freaking over things like $18 stir fried noodles (with no meat nonetheless) and $28 for essentially 8 dumplings (albeit very good ones) .  But alas...happy wife, happy life!  She really enjoyed the dinner and preferred this over Tao.  I disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  There were a couple of excellent dishes but it's simply the principle of paying this much for it that endlessly irks me.  So let's start with those:OUTSTANDING DISHES:Crispy Duck Salad:  My Hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before.  The server said it was her favorite thing on the menu.  Who am I to argue?  It was the best thing we had.  The duck was cooked perfectly and combining it with greens, pomegranate, pomelo and pine nuts made for a super tasty dish.  I am pretty sure I will order this every time I dine here.  It won't be many more unless I am getting comped but this is a MUST HAVE.  Stir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included ""Try a Little Tenderness"" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  DECENT:Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter:  I won't go into the names of them all but there was shrimp, fish, scallop and duck.  The fish was ground up and then secured in a black squid ink wrap.  The scallop had a little ikura on top which was a nice touch.  I chose to eat the majority of these dumplings straight without sauce to get the full taste of it.  They offered 3 sauces with them but vinegar would have been nice as Yelper Cynthia C. mentioned in her review.The cocktails were also decent but I forget the names of them.DON'T EVEN BOTHER:To sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. Four Style Vegetable in sweet Szechuan sauce:  I didn't plan on ordering this but the server recommended it.  We had also been eating a little more unhealthy than usual that week so both of us thought a few veggies would help.  This was a joke.  The sweet and spice didn't work and the medley of asparagus, shimeji mushroom, yam bean (had the consistency of apple) and tofu was weird for me.  Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive: I was recommended this dish before coming and I got it even though I was still skeptical.  This would've been good if it were $5 but not $18.  The food wasn't the only thing going on here.  I liked how the tables were sectioned off to handle small and larger parties.  The atmosphere was pretty chill at the time we were there (7pm Saturday) but I imagine it might get a little more rockin later in the evening.  The service was surprisingly excellent and our main server was incredibly nice.  They also offered some tasting courses that looked pretty interesting but you had to have a minimum of 4 to do it.  I don't regret coming here but there are a lot of better options at this price point in the MGM like Craftsteak.",33,20,uSuo_Dw7zf2TIapWcusXaw,7/6/2013,3,18,87,Restaurant

Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty ""Flash Gordon"" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  If you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  Like Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  I had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the ""Prosciutto San Daniele"" since we recently had Carnevino's ""Prosciutto di Parma Riserva"", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....Another highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.Although the ""Veal Chop Saltimbocca"" was an impressive looking entrxc3xa9e in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  The dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.",84,54,eQBmCql_FreT6pDaus5CbQ,10/16/2014,4,41,65,Restaurant

If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  At least those Restaurant offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of ""Irashaimase!"" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the ""Sahara Cooler"" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit purxc3xa9e, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the ""Wafu Carbonara"" which was simply described as ""slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg"".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.

The hot spots just keep on coming to SW Vegas and I love it!!Starters:Bow down to their ""Bao Sliders"", consisting of pork sausage, fried quail egg, crispy shallots and jalapeno aioli; THIS is an absolute must order.  The pillow-like buns and thin sliver of Chinese sausage combined with everything else it had going on tasted like the best news I'd get all day.  It is a remarkable bite that I totally wish could be made as a full size burger. The ""Crispy Mediterranean Octopus"" was another outstanding appetizer with Spanish baby octopus and the amazing lick off the plate purple basil vadouvan  (curry) sauce that shot it up several levels.  Shareability would have improved had there been chopsticks for everyone, which they don't have, which is kinda weird.  Entrees:The ""Scottish King Salmon"" is a dish that could easily have been on the menu at Harvest by Roy Ellamar at Bellagio.  Scented farro, smoked eggplant, fresh plum salad with a gorgeously cooked salmon filet (that skin!) sitting on top was superb and arguably the best entrxc3xa9e they offer.   Free parking made it taste even better.  I detected distinct Taiwanese flavors from the uber tender ""Braised Duroc Pork Belly"" with mustard greens.  The eye pleasing sticky rice encased in a flavorful bamboo leaf that accompanied it was a nice play on the classic ""bah-tzang"" I used to pig out on by the dozen as a kid.   No one could go wrong with the fantastic ""Slow Cooked Short Rib"" coupled with the summer squash ratatouille, which made for a great flavor combination.  I also fully enjoyed sampling my wife's ""Fried Whole Rainbow Trout"" with sautxc3xa9ed rainbow Swiss chard and ginger/rice wine vinegar sauce.  Big thanks to our server for advising me to eat the fish head!  It was an absolute joy of crunchy fried goodness.  Do it!!The only entrxc3xa9e that wasn't on the same level was the hanger steak.  Perhaps just having had a magnificent one at Jaleo days before raised my expectations too high. Potato/potahto though!  Clearly there is plenty of stuff to like from this unique eatery and I'll be back for more soon.4.39872186204 stars!",98,78,cSV_zh1Qwwrqm4TPTxbFkg,7/26/2017,4,64,64,Restaurant

Our Italian waiter named ""Loan"" was totally on point from start to finish.  The tableside Caesar salad (which originated from Mexico and has nothing to do with Italy) he made was a marvel.  He made the dressing from scratch right in front of us starting with the egg yolk, spices, anchovy and everything else after.  It was so cool to watch.  He certainly wasn't modest about his tableside Caesar skills either saying he ""made it the best"" and it delivered!  This is a must order and for $9 a person is a better deal than the other salads on the menu.  4 stars:I am a sucker for handmade pasta but we thought ordering a full entree plate of that would be insanely too much food so we begrudgingly went with the lobster black truffle baked ziti.  This was supposed to be a side dish but it was a huge portion easily for 4 people and it was so good!  They definitely didn't skimp on the lobster meat and it made for great leftovers the next day.  Nutfish Z's great review twisted my arm into ordering the ""Andiamo Grande Meatball"".  Just what I need right?  A meat appetizer followed by an entree of more meat!  The meatball was a little smaller than the size of a softball and was a handmade blend of veal, pork and beef.   It was a little more on the solid side and the sauce with the ricotta cheese topping really was a great blend of flavor.  Nice meatball!  This is not to be mistaken for their side dish of meatballs which is only beef and pork.   3 stars:We got a side order of the ""olive oil grilled asparagus with cipollini onions"" which was a nice sized portion compared to most other steakhouses.  The sauce on top was good and I like cipollini onions on pretty much anything including Fruity Pebbles.  2 stars:Our waiter gave us 2 surprise plates of spaghetti topped with a kind of tomato cream sauce courtesy of the chef right before our entrees came out.  It was totally unnecessary filler considering we already ordered a pasta dish and I didn't think it was very good.  I saw Ron S's photo afterward with his caption asking if the sauce came from a can.  I thought the same thing!  My wife liked it better than I did.  I know I sound like a putz complaining about free food but this wasn't needed at all and I would just set this aside if/when they give it to you before the entrees come out.  1 star:It pains me to even write this but it was the goddamn steak itself!!  I got the bone in ribeye (had plans to go for the Tomahawk after Teri W's great review but they have since upped the price from $65 to $79) and my wife got the filet mignon.  I take my first bite and shake my head kinda like ""huh""?  I take another bite, get more perplexed and then I take a final bite from a different section, turn to my wife and say ""this is not good at all"".  The ribeye was lukewarm at best, dry and wasn't even up to par with the $13 flat iron steak I had at Herbs and Rye a few days before that.  My wife's filet mignon was good....if you want it to taste like AHI TUNA!!!  She was surprisingly OK with it though so who was I to argue?  Loan comes back, asks how things are and I tell him my problems with the ribeye.  It was as if this quality of steak should have been saved for fools that ordered well done.  It also seemed like the steak had been sitting in the kitchen for a while based on the temperature.  Loan seemed stunned by this as was I.  I've had plenty of ribeyes and this was the first time I've ever sent one back.  I've only thought about doing it one other time (N9NE) but didn't pull the trigger.  I would've sent back my wife's filet had I ordered that as well.  I got the porterhouse instead which was MILES AND MILES better.  It was juicy and beefy where it was supposed to be and the temperature was to my satisfaction.  That was 3.5 stars.  So in the end, I would still come back here for the Italian fare, Caesar salad, ambiance and service but you might want to stick with Vic and Anthony's a couple of casinos over if you're looking for great steak.",20,11,nuNxx1_88ybqUkKsbvzv1Q,10/8/2013,3,12,62,Restaurant

We chose this place based on the reviews and the fact we hadn't dined at Bellagio in quite a while.  With so many great eats popping up everywhere on the strip, you almost take for granted such great resorts like this.I made the reservation about a month beforehand and only had a choice of 5:45 or earlier or 8pm on.  8pm it was.  The really cool decor is what strikes you upon entering along with a single rose given to the wife.  It's classy and cool with some bright colors thrown in.  We didn't get to have a cocktail at the bar as we were seated within seconds of looking at the drink menu.  Service was impeccable and the 5 course dinner was unique and delicious.  The standout dishes included the Santa Barbara sea urchin with king crab.  My wife doesn't even like urchin and she finished it pretty quick.  Foie gras was awesome as expected.  I took a shot on the ""Ris de Veau"" which I had never had before.  It's essentially veal guts that may or may not have contained the throat, pancreas, heart, belly etc.  I think the majority of it was stomach.  It was interesting to say the least, almost tasted like high-end cow brain.  Glad I tried it but I would go with my wife's terrific beef dish if I could do it again.  I finished it like a good boy :)The desserts were very cool.  I'd never seen anything like the chocolate cigar with passion fruit sorbet which came in it's own ashtray.  I posted a pic of it.  My wife went with the sugar sphere with yuzu and raspberry.  That came in a clear hardshell sugar ball filled with the fruit inside.  You simply had to tap the top of the ball for it to crack and enjoy.  They also brought out some extra bite sized sweets and presented my wife with some extra chocolates as we were leaving.  So why 4 stars?  I've had better dining experiences in Vegas.  Not just around town but at Bellagio itself.  I would rather do Picasso for the price.  And while the decor was nice, the tables were a bit cramped which didn't make Le Cirque as romantic as it could be.  You were able to listen to everyone else's conversations at all the tables nearby.  One couple two tables down kept going on and on about their kids and how they own 3 doughnut shops in Canada to some couple just trying to enjoy their own company.

Bellagio and Wynn also had 60+ minute waits too.  My genius dad proposed dinner at St Mark's Square at Venetian since they enjoyed walking around there the other day.  I made a reservation for both here and Postrio on the way and she chose Canaletto after looking at both menus.Even though you're in a mall, it's not just any mall that offers surroundings like this.  The dim evening lighting of the square, the music and atmosphere gives you a really decent simulation of Piazza San Marco although my parents said it's much busier here than the actual one.  Having no pigeons around is nice too :PMost locals would probably consider Canaletto a total tourist trap but I thought it was a lot of fun.  How have I not taken any of our out of town friends or family here before?  Our server was terrific.  He was super friendly, had great knowledge of the menu and made our experience better than I expected.Appetizers:We started with the ""Bruschetta Caldo"".  I liked that the bread was grilled and you could tell the tomatoes were really fresh.   We also had the ""Calamaretti Fritti"" or fried calamari.  It came with surprisingly few tentacles (much to the happiness of some at the table) and the tartar sauce was a big hit compared to the marinara.  The ""Insalata Canaletto"" was pretty basic with greens, cheese, oil and large croutons.Entrees:I got the ""Tagliatelle alla Castellana"" which was comprised of ""pasta ribbons tossed with pork tenderloin, bacon, shiitake mushrooms, Grana Padano andthyme in brandy-cream sauce"".  It was rich and flavorful.  I could only finish half since we loaded up on bread in the beginning but it was really good and the pasta tasted homemade.  My mom got the ""Maiale Kurobuta Ripieno"".  That was an ""herb-stuffed center-cut Kurobuta pork chop wrapped in pancetta, topped with kalamata olivesand capers; served with roasted Yukon Gold potatoes and sautxc3xa9ed organic spinach"".  This was a MONSTER cut of pork that was really delicious.  I would've gnawed on the bone had I not stuffed myself to be honest. On a side note, the servers probably go insane with all the customers butchering the names of these dishes!  Try saying ""Petto Di Pollo Al Pepperoncino"" 5 times!  Or even better yet, ""FILETTO DI BRANZINO AL PROSECCO E ZAFFERANO""?!?!  How do they avoid laughing?My wife really liked her veal scaloppine or as the Italians would say ""SCALOPPINE CON FUNGHI E SPECK"".  They were 4 pieces of delicious, boneless pieces with great sauce, portobello mushrooms and some really good grilled polenta.  My dad got the house special that night which was a linguine dish with seafood.  I didn't even try his since I was so stuffed with my own but he said he liked it a lot.  Dessert:Our waiter surprised my mom and brought out a tiramisu with a candle.  It actually ended up being a really great evening despite our initial plans going awry!!  I will certainly take more visitors here.      This spellcheck should take about a decade.....",16,10,hDjiJwePH1gRWUdyw6y1Mg,4/13/2013,4,11,57,Restaurant

The service, quality of ingredients, creativity, and a yearning for a more shared experience guarantee a return visit.  Perhaps Willy Wonka and Marilyn Manson would be my dream dinner companions to get bizarre with at Bazaar.  The dxc3xa9cor is pretty unique.  With Jose Andres being the culinary advisor for NBC's recently cancelled TV version of ""Hannibal"", the area is a little treat for fans.  From the large blown glass above the front bar looking like long drops of blood, to all the deer heads making me feel like I was in the middle of a Will Graham hallucination, the style and vision of the show has its fingerprints all over the space.  The beef cheek was done wonderfully.  It was the tenderest version of cow face I've ever had,  probably because of its wagyuness.  I liked how it was served like steak instead of a stew or overly saucy.  Safe to say, the distinct texture was not a hit with everyone as I alone reached for seconds and thirds.  It's a good thing we got something a little more traditional like the chateaubriand presented already sliced.  Those big slices of rare meat were excellent.  Maybe it was just me feeling ""Hannibalistic"" at the moment, but the corn feed flavor and iron taste of the tenderloin really popped.  Unbelievably to me, the 2 pound grilled Maine lobster was the best dish we had.  Whatever the crack sauce was that the cook put on top took my taste buds into overdrive.  The head of the lobster was an absolute delight.  The tomalley (aka the uni of the lobster) mixed with the sauce and that awesome grill flavor was one of the best things I've had in recent memory.  My Asianess begged me to order a bowl of white rice to mix it all with, but I ended up diving straight into it with two hands until there was nothing left to gnaw on.  Who needs a damn bib?So is it worth it?  If the plan is to get a ribeye and potatoes, I would go to Carnevino over this.

Yesterday's red carpeted grand opening gave me the chance to sample their food and wine menu.  It appears they kept the original inside dcor and the running water above and below creates a serene atmosphere.Describing their food as 'sushi & gourmet fusion', you see a range of Asian techniques in their cooking.  * Boca Park Roll (Deep fried yellowtail topped with spicy tuna and scallions, served with eel sauce and spicy aioli.) - My favorite of those offered - eat it while it's hot!* Cucumber Wrap (A riceless sushi adventure with tuna, salmon, albacore, crab, avocado, and kaiware wrapped with cucumber.) - It's refreshing and light, and a nice contrast against other rolls with heavy sauces.* 9th Isle (Spicy tuna roll with spicy shrimp tempura, cucumber and kaiware sprouts served with sweet glazed unagi.) - Eel lovers and those scared off by the raw will enjoy this roll.* TNT (California roll topped with baked rock shrimp, shitake mushroom, and scallop with creamy aioli and sweet onion sauce.) - The mushroom topping dominates.* Baja Roll (California roll topped with marinated tuna, tomato, flying fish roe and green onion.) - One again, the toppings are coming off, but refreshing with the tomatoes.* Sea Stone Rainbow (A riceless sushi delight made with ahi tuna, salmon, snapper, and crab mix, rolled in soybean paper and served with balsamic-mango reduction.) - Reminds me of a spring roll and enjoyable for those watching their carb intake.Dim sum offerings included the shrimp puff, which came with a mayo dipping sauce.  It was loaded with shrimp and yummy when eaten hot.  I also tried the steamed pork and vegetable purse, aka siu mai or pork dumpling.  These were standard with other dim sum Restaurant.One of my favorites was the Peanut Crusted Hibachi Satays (Grilled chicken thighs with cilantro, Fresno chiles, lemongrass, coconut, and soy peanut vinaigrette.).  It was full of flavor and the sauce was delicious!  The Beef Negimayaki (Tender and juicy teriyaki beef skewers with scallion kimchi filling, garlic and a light tomato relish.) was okay, the beef was rolled around the scallion and skewered, didn't taste as exception as it sounded.  The Stuffed Ahi Carpaccio (Thinly sliced ahi rolled around crab ceviche with jalapeno, salsa, baby greens and a ponzu glaze.) had a bit of caviar on top that made it decadent.A nice twist was the Haricot Vert & Asparagus Salad (Tomato concassee, frisee, chevre cheese and glazed walnuts with mustard vinaigrette.) which can be heavy with the goat cheese.  The nuts provide a sweet and crunchy texture to the softness of the cheese.Of the entre samples, my favorite was the Baked Miso Yaki Butterfish (Shiro miso, sake, mirin and ginger, served with braised coconut rice.).  The fish was soft and silky and the rice was like butter, so good!  The Grilled Black Angus Strip (Roasted garlic herb butter, served with cured tomatoes and roasted sweet potatoes.) wasn't as tender as I had hoped, but the potatoes were a lovely treat!  I heard great things about the Potato-Crusted Salmon (Served with stir-fried vegetables and a ginger lime butter sauce.), but it didn't live up to the excitement.  The potatoes were shoe-string and would come off in one piece and the salmon was standard.  The stir-fried veggies were julienne-cut, so the flavors were muddled together.  The Braised Tofu with Spicy Tomato Black Bean Sauce (Soft tofu coated in potato starch and fried in vegetable oil, braised in vegetable stock, soy and chili sauce and served with tomato concassee and black beans.) is typical of what I find at Chinese Restaurant.  However, the tomato added a slight contrast that made it unique and possibly, a vegetarian's dream.  With all the heavy eating, I was pleased with their dessert offerings.  They had two sweets to choose from - the Chocolate Zen and the White Chocolate Bliss.  I preferred the chocolate with its flourless, ganache-glazed dark chocolate cake over the white chocolate and coconut sponge cake.Not only did Sea Stone go all out on the food, they provided ample wine and sake tasting.  They had an extensive wine list, but their sake list is what kept me happy.  Not only do they offer traditional sake, but those who enjoy the sweeter side of life will enjoy Hana's fruit-based ones (Fuji Apple, Raspberry, and Lychee) and the Star Rabbit ""Blueberry Infused"" sparkling sake.  I'm a big fan of the sweet stuff, but the new discovery of the blueberry sparkling one was a fab find!Overall, Sea Stone is another Asian fusion restaurant in the Vegas scene.  Their market is different being off strip though and based in Boca Park.  They have a nice outdoor lounge area that would be great for after work dinner drinks and eats.  They offer some typical Asian fare and sushi, and some unique concoctions as well.  I'd be back to sample their other creative inventions.",5,2,PVact0VNn5IHCJ9abM3KIQ,4/25/2008,4,0,93,Restaurant

Our waiter swiftly took them away (as they were $100 pieces of steak)!  Then the Big F noticed some discussion going on at a nearby table and had a feeling that they received our starters.

They had us scooping up all the sauce we could!or* Sushi Sampler ""4 pieces hamachi verde: (yellowtail, scallions, Thai chilis topped with cilantro, and thinly sliced limes) and 2 pieces temari scallop (slices of tuna around spicy sea scallops with wasabi flying fish roe and wasabi aioli)."" - The hamachi verde is a refreshing sushi roll with the lime slices, but it's the temari scallop roll that was the real winner.  We really enjoyed the scallop and wasabi aioli, it had us wanting more!Entrees, choice of:* Miso Braised Kobe Short Rib ""shiitake mushrooms, grilled asparagus, crisp maui onions"" - One of their most popular dishes, and you can easily see why.  The morsels of meat were gently braised and quite delicious.  The buttery mashed potatoes were just fattening and oh-so good!  A heavy dish indeed!or * Opakapaka Lau Lau ""coconut ginger cream, kobocha squash and banana chutney."" - Beautifully presented where they 'release' the banana leaves to showcase the hidden secrets that lay within.  I'm not one for cooked fish, but this was extraordinary.  Not dry at all, and the sweetness from the banana chutney adds a completely new dimension to it.  I would go back and order this again for sure!Desserts, choice of:* Chocolate Lava Cake - A molten center with lovely sauces and fresh berries that come with it. or *Asian Pear Tart - Oh my gawd delicious.  So good that it's not worth sharing.  The tart is flaky and light, and the asian pears are sweet and just perfect.  And the sauces that come with it only add to the happy hum in your mouth.  Worth driving out this way just for a slice of heaven.  It's definitely one of my favorite desserts ever.  You probably saw me licking the plate!Our waiter forgot that we ordered the sake flight, a sampling of four sakes ($19).  And when we told him midway through our meal that he could just forget about it, he decided instead to give it to us complimentary!  The four samples included ""shirakaberuga junmai, dewazakura ""oka"", hoyo ""fair maiden"", and creme de sake.""  We did notice that it was hard to find our waiter and it looked understaffed.  When we had a chance to chat with the waiter later on, he did confirm that it was understaffed that night, which definitely explains the mix-up with all the food.Despite all the weird service, I'd give Marssa a 4.5.  (I'm sure it would be a solid 5 during our return visit.  We're told we have to try their Dinner for Two Sushi Platters created by Master Sushi Chef Osama ""Fuji"" Fujita!)  Master Fuji was actually on hand when we left so we got to say hi too!  With him being the ONLY master sushi chef in Nevada, how can you resist not sitting in front of him?But if we don't go for sushi, I'd definitely return for their other entrees instead.  This is one of my top choices for a nice date restaurant!(And you know pics are posted of this fabulous dinner!)Update! 12/08 - Returned for another fabulous visit.  This time we sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed wonderful food and fabulous service.",6,4,JLnbMwah4NPZNZpowPkDkg,9/18/2008,5,4,91,Restaurant

And that doesn't happen very often, so I love to take advantage of the cheap eats and atmosphere that happens during these brief few hours.We arrived around 5 pm and waited a good while to score a table on the patio.  We thought we were in luck when a group of ladies said they were leaving once their friend returned from the restroom.  Well, she must have fell in because it was a good 15 minutes before they did finally leave.  At this point, our total wait time was 45 minutes long.We were hungry and got our hands on a menu quick!  All food was $5 and under!  With our party of three, we got started on a few items:* Atlantic Roll ""Baked salmon with motoyaki sauce and cucumbers, topped with tempura flakes and eel sauce"" ($3) - Our waiter said it was his favorite and I'm not usually one for cooked fish in my rolls, but I still said okay.  It was good, not exceptional though.  Came in eight pieces, which is great for sharing!* Spicy Tuna Roll ""Chopped tuna mixed with spicy motoyaki and cucumbers"" ($3) - Again, pretty basic and decent and 8 pieces too.* Kona Calamari ""Served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce"" ($4.50) - A pretty generous order, great for sharing.* Sweet & Spicy Shrimp ""Lightly battered shrimp tossed in a sweet and spicy chili sauce, served on a bed of a daikon"" ($4.50) - Pretty tasty and surprisingly generous in this order.* Chicken Satay ""With cabbage slaw and sweet hoisin dipping sauce"" ($4.50) - Came with four skewers, and a nice slaw to get your veggies from.  A bit dry on the chicken, but enjoyed by others.* Avocado Egg Roll ""Sun-dried tomatoes and red onions, with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce"" ($4.50) - Two egg rolls cut in half, and tasty too.* Kahuna Sliders ""A trio of beef sliders seasoned with onions and thyme, topped with Swiss and cheddar cheese"" ($4.50) - The Husband enjoyed these so much that he requested another order.  They were pretty good, cooked at medium rare as requested and yummy little things.  The meat was pretty moist and the melted cheese on top made them perfect as a few bites.  They also came with thinly sliced fried onions strings.* Edamame ($3) - Soybeans that were lightly salted throughout the beans, not just on top.We didn't even get a chance to try any of their pizzas at $5 each since we ordered so much.Service was surprisingly good during happy hour.  Christian was attentive, even when the other staff brought our food out, he was quick to come over to make sure it was all okay and everything was in order.  He checked on us often for more drinks and food and we never had to look for him during our entire time there.  Once we got our order in, food came out in timely manner and we were quite pleased.  (Sometimes it seems service gets a bit slack during happy hour, when the pace should be more upbeat.  And it was definitely moving around here.)Happy hours are Mondays through Fridays: 3 to 7 pmReverse happy hours are Mondays through Thursdays: 9 pm to 11 pmFridays and Saturdays: 10 pm to 12 amHH is only available in the lounge and patio areas and seats are self-service.  So it can definitely feel like there are hounds on you when you're hanging out there because people are definitely waiting for tables here.They have discounted drink specials during happy hour too, just be sure to ask.  We took advantage of their $6.50 Sake Bombs and $3 Ladies Margaritas.  (They weren't skimping on the alcohol in my margarita, I could taste and feel that stuff right away!)You can easily understand why this happy hour is busy.  And there are some guests who stay there all evening long, it makes for interesting people watching!Side note: Restrooms are in the back left hand corner.

They are two choices for lunch - a la carte or the prix-fix menu at $25!  And at $25, what a steal!  How could I resist?  I have already heard great things about this place by my Vegas go to man, so how can I say no?!  (I tried going on a weekend and only discovered then that they weren't open for lunch on weekends!  Wow!)  At Rosemary's, there is a good selection of starters, entrees, and desserts to choose from for the prix-fix menu, making this place an ideal choice for a variety of palates.To start, I had the recommended Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.  What a fabulous and light salad to start with!  The cheese is swirled into the beef and has an amazing mix of flavors going on in your mouth!  Yum yum!My entree was the Soy Marinated Bistro Filet Kabobs with Prosciutto-Wild Mushroom Hash, Micro Greens & Caramelized Shallot Reduction Sauce.  The kabobs came on two skewer sticks.  They were small pieces of beef, but full of flavor.  The mix of mushrooms and greens complemented the dish well.  My companion had his favorite - the Crispy Leg of Duck Confit on a bed of French Green Lentils with a Brandy Green Peppercorn Sauce. The crispy skin of the duck was full of flavor, but the dish wasn't a particular favorite of mine.  I was more pleased with my beef kabobs.For dessert, I closed with the Chocolate Flourless Cake with Scotch Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Ice Cream.  I noticed they were offering Peppermint Ice Cream in another dessert and asked if they could substitute the vanilla for peppermint and it was done!  The toasted almond slivers added a nice crunch to the cake and sweet ice cream.  The cookie underneath the ice cream also added a nice bite to the lovely dessert as well.  I was pleased with my choice!  My companion had the Goat Cheese Cheesecake with Scotch Caramel Sauce.  The goat cheese was a bit heavy for me, especially after my very filling starter and entree, so I was glad I stuck with my chocolate cake.  He seemed quite content with the stronger tasting and pungent dessert than I.Service - amazingly fabulous!  Servers here are particularly anal and I love it!  The old school way of serving from the left and taking from the right applies here!  And my favorite - the waiters wait until all plates are present and they are set down in front of each diner at the same time.  Love it!  They also fold your napkin and push in your chair should you use the restroom during your meal.  This place works fabulously as a team and they get FIVE stars on service alone!  (This was just for lunch too!)  I can't wait to go back for more!Side note: Check out their website for various promotions going on like half price wine night on Sundays and ladies' night on Wednesdays, which means half off!  You can even purchase $100 GC for $79.99 at Las Vegas Costcos!Update!  02/02/08 - Had the pleasure of having their prix-fix lunch here again today and couldn't pass up the ""Dry Aged Beef & Maytag Blue Cheese Carpaccio with Arugula & Granny Smith Apple Salad, Candied Walnuts & Port Wine Drizzles.""  It's so good that the BF and I each order our own plate.  (We usually like to get different things and share, but this one is so good we just want our own!)For the main, I had the ""Creole Seasoned Shrimp with Anson Mills Carolina Cheesy Quick Grits, Andouille Red Bean Sauce & Grilled Green Onion.""  It was so much food!  Embarrassingly, I couldn't finish it all!  Too much grits!  The BF had ""Rosie's Monte Cristo - Ham, Turkey & Cantal Cheese on Battered Dipped Brioche with Crispy Onion Crust.""  I especially liked his flaky and light onion rings.  Again, very plentiful and he couldn't finish it all either!The BF ordered some kind of dessert that I forgot the name of.  The waiter said it was really good, but it was alright to us.  (You can check out the photos from the business profile and tell me what it was!)  I had the trio of seasonal sorbets because you can never go wrong with seasonal sorbets!  Yum yum!We had to sit in the front this time since there were no tables available where we could sit side by side.  Service was still good for the most part, but I think it's a bit better when you're inside.  And I should mention the yummy bread rolls they give you in the beginning, oh so good!",2,3,OF01E0Eem9teRU5Pc2qj0w,11/28/2006,5,0,87,Restaurant

The menu at Cafe Deia caught our attention, along with a few other specials they were offering.Starting off with their White Sangria ($20 pitcher), I found it to be a bit strong and not sweet enough.  I had to ask for some simple syrup so I could enjoy it morel.  Like Amy S. mentioned, they could really use some real fruit in there.  I like my sangria loaded with fruit and it's mostly lemon slices in there.A pretty large menu to choose from, but we decided to go with tapas all the way.* Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese ""Thinly sliced imported Serrano ham served with Manchego and a French baguette"" ($9) - Highly recommended by our waiter, Chris.  Warm baguette arrived with a few slices of cheese and salty ham. Yes, it's good and very rustic.  Reminds me of the kind of food you grab for a picnic when you're overseas.  They give you more bread if you need it too!* Tuna Tartar ""Diced ahi tuna mixed in wasabi, soy sauce and Asian chili paste served with avocado and green onions"" ($8) - The avocado and tomatoes are served in a crispy shell with the tuna mixture and hard-boiled egg bits on the side.  Good, but needs some assembling if you want to get all the tastes in your mouth at once.* Shrimp Ceviche ""Tiger shrimp cooked in lime and lemon juice, mixed with avocado, cucumber, red onions and chili pepper"" ($9) - Generous on the shrimp and tasty!  It was good on its own and presented in a nice manner too.* Bacon Wrapped Figs ""Fresh figs wrapped in bacon and pan seared"" ($7) - My absoluter favorite dish of the evening.  A total flavor explosion in your mouth!  The balsamic vinegar sauce adds a nice acidity and sweetness, and is just delicious!  * Stuffed Mushrooms ""Stuffed Chorizo mushrooms, and baked to perfection."" ($4) - Yummy little buggers as well, along with the balsamic vinegar sauce drizzled on the bottom.  Good stuff! * Black Mediterranean Mussels in Garlic White Wine Sauce ""Sauteed in garlic and white wine"" ($9) - Came with bread which is needed to sop up all that wine and garlic sauce laying beneath the mussels.  Yum.* Mallorcan Soup ""the only soup you can eat with a fork! pork, vegetables and bread slowly cooked in olive oil and natural juices"" ($5) - It's 'interesting' if anything.  More stew-like, and not one of my favorites although the Husband enjoyed it.Dessert menus are delivered in a letter.* Fruit Beignet $3 - Pretty disappointing.  Nothing to rave about.  The batter had hints of all the other savory foods that it was fried with.* Chocolate Banana Crepe ($5) - Highly recommended by our waiter, especially since I wasn't impressed with the beignet.  The crepes were okay, a bit too thick for my liking.  Reminded me of pancakes, which I'm more of a waffle kind of girl.  Simple crepes, folded over, then slices of banana, chocolate sauce, and powdered sugar go on top.  I think the Spanish Creme Brulee ($7) or Chocolate Lave Cake ($7) would have fared better.We did try ordering:* Sausage Platter ""Assorted imported Spanish sausages served with a French baguette"" ($8) - Our waiter wasn't too fond of this and pushed the Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese dish on us instead.* Albondigas ""Ground beef meatballs served in a spicy tomato sauce"" ($5) - Again, we wanted to order this, but was discouraged to do so.  Just as well from reading all the other reviews about this dish.Overall, service was good.  Chris was attentive as well as the other staff that helped along.  The food came out a bit too fast for the two of us, so we had to make room quickly at our table.  The chef came by at one point to check on our meal, which I definitely appreciated that personal touch.  (The Husband also noticed the chef helping out with front room duties too.)  We also saw salads made table side, which is totally unnecessary but a nice presentational effect.They have a lot of promise.  An outdoor eating area with firepit and happy hour specials can definitely pull in the crowds.  We went during their Mardi Gras specials.  The tapas we ordered are perfect for two to three sharing, maybe even four.  They also serve up salads, paellas, burgers, and pizza if you want something more for just yourself too.

I was a bit disappointed that my version didn't come with ikura as I had seen other diners receive, but it was an interesting start to our meal.* Crispy Brussel Sprouts ""brussel sprouts, lemon chili, mint, puffed rice"" ($6) - This came out rather immediately and set the tone for the rest of the meal.  (The Husband had high hopes for this dish and the result would probably reflect how much we would enjoy the rest of our dinner.)  It was good...really good.  Yes, damn good.  It was a generous amount and we were loving it.  We were delighted.  * Crudo ""sea bass, heirloom tomato, ikura, candied quinoa, lemon herb oil"" ($12) - This next course took quite awhile to come out.  It wasn't as if they were cooking anything for it, but we were twiddling our thumbs waiting.  The presentation of this dish could be as to why the wait.  The candied quinoa is definitely different as its uncooked quinoa.  The Husband only wished he had more.* Takorizo ""grilled japanese octopus, chorizo, melon, almonds, salsa verde, black olive oil"" ($16) - Again, quite a wait for this dish too.  The octopus was warm, the melon was cool.  You need to take a bite of the chorizo, melon and octopus altogether to really appreciate the sweet and salty factor.* Hotateyaki ""sea scallops, tomatillo, cauliflower, grapefruit-ginger-miso vinaigrette"" ($13) - At this point, we realized we needed a fork and knife to cut down the food as chopsticks weren't cutting it.  (Plus, most items were served in quantities of five and we are all about sharing equally here!)  Another dish that requires you to get a piece of the scallop, tomatillo, and grapefruit segment all at once.* Compressed watermelon - This was a complimentary dish, again something I had seen served with big eye tuna for other diners.  It was soaked in fish sauce, but was quite refreshing. * Sake Orenji ""atlantic salmon, orange supreme, yuzu tobiko, lemon oil, maldon"" ($10) - It was among one of our favorites.  The salmon and orange segments were a bit large and needed to be cut down, but the sauce that it lay in along with the yuzu tobiko were delicious.  My only problem was that the tobiko would fall off the fish and into the sauce and I had to dig around to get every little morsel out.  The busboy wanted to clear my plate and I was definitely not done digging around!* Sakana Dore ""fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed"" ($15) - We were told the fish of the day was albacore and Yonaka was the only place in the Valley that had fresh albacore versus frozen albacore.  The waitress said it came from Hawai'i, so we decided to order it.  However, it came out with salmon instead of albacore.  They ended up comping this dish for us while they made a new order with albacore.  You really need to get every component of the dish into your mouth to enjoy the food.  The yuzu honey was superb!* Sakana Dore ""fish of the day, bell pepper, zucchini chips, apple, micro greens, yuzu honey, tosaka seaweed"" ($15) - This time it came with albacore, but the Husband actually preferred the salmon version.  This version was a bit fishier, but still good nonetheless.  And we were happy to get more yuzu honey!* Shioyaki Saba ""grilled norwegian mackerel, cucumber, lemon, parsley"" ($5) - Considering they said the dishes were meant to be shared, the saba was one large piece of fish sitting on a bed of English cucumbers.  Thank goodness for our knife and fork because we needed to cut down the cucumbers to enjoy a piece with every bite of fish, which was just cooked perfectly.  We made a point of pulling the fish to the side so it didn't soak up the sauce too quickly.* Machitaki ""yellowtail tataki, asparagus, yuca chips, tomato ginger puree, soy pudding"" ($13) - This dish came highly recommended by our waitress and for good reason.  It was among one of my favorites.  The soy pudding wasn't exactly what I was expecting as its rather concentrated soy sauce and not soy like tofu.  Instead of asparagus, we got avocado, which tasted great anyway.* Chokoreto ""lime, chocolate, mint, avocado"" ($7) - A generous chocolate heavy dessert with chocolate cookie, chocolate cookie crumbles, chocolate torte/pudding, lime sorbet, and dots of mint and avocado sauce.  I think I could have used a bit more mint and avocado though.Service - Ashlee, our waitress, was great - attentive and relatively knowledgeable.  The busboys were bit overanxious with trying to clear our plates, twice reaching from behind me and over my shoulder.  Water glasses were filled very quickly though!  I thought the music was a little too loud.  (And no hot water in the restroom?)  Overall, beautiful presentation with foods jumping from savory to sweet to tangy.4.5 stars and only three weeks since it's been open.",11,11,LcePuRi9cbeWG0pnxQSUcQ,2/5/2013,5,7,84,Restaurant

Featuring a special ""Election Day Menu"" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opportunity!Drinks on the menu:* Obamarama (blue) for $11 ""Svedka Citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry"" - Really good the first time around. Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.* Maverick (red) for $11 ""Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava"" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.Bites to eat:* Shishito Peppers ($2) ""grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon"" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn't really care for more.* Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.  That was the best part of it.  Our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? Hmm... * Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($3) - Really good roll!  I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it's more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.* Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I'm sad I didn't order more.* Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) ""cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain"" - Our friend's order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  Ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  It wasn't particularly exceptional, it was okay.  I don't remember any plantain in my dish though.  * Japanese Chicken Wings ($4) ""teriyaki and sesame"" - It's hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  Good, but messy.* Chilled Oyster Sampler ($4) ""ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters"" - Really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  We were supposed to get another order before we left, so I missed out on more!  Next time!* Mini Yellowtail Seviche ($4) ""ginger garlic and soy"" - Reminded me of Hawaiian poke with the dressing.  It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.* Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) ""shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce"" xc3xa2"" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!* Rosca ($9) ""homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce"" xc3xa2"" Recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.We spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.

(Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)Overall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can't beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.3.5 stars.They also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.(Pics posted, of course!)",8,8,iM6lYtgumX49AjUj0HtdgQ,11/14/2008,4,4,83,Restaurant

It was about a 30 minute wait for our party of two.  We were already invested, and decided to hold out...especially if we were going to be seated at the counter.  (This is the place you want to be seated at, by the way.)The menu is prix fixe at $19 - you get an Amuse, a Choice of Dessert, and a Petit Four.  You can only share with another person by adding either another entree (Choice of Dessert) or an Amuse and a Petit Four.  We opted for another Choice of Dessert.  An additional $7 if you would like to do a dessert wine pairing.One of the things I love is the attention to detail and care.  Even before we were seated, the staff are certain to make sure everything is in place before they will allow you to sit down.  The hostess was bent down on the floor sweeping with a dustpan even!Besides the obvious water bottle display as soon as you walk through the door, it's actually a wine cellar if you can believe it!  They didn't expect to get their liquor license in time, so they filled it up with the different color labeled bottles of water in the meantime.  But ultimately, it's supposed to be displaying wine. The waitress hands us a menu wrapped up in a ring and you can immediately tell there's something different about the menu.  It's edible rice paper and a ring made from pulled sugar.  This isn't your average dessert joint.  They pour raspberry sauce for you to dip your paper in to enjoy, so don't start chomping on the paper just yet.  (We even got a new menu and ring to take home.)  Even the cutlery and water pitcher is something to take notice of.* Amuse: Mango Sorbet with Mint Jelly - Our first thought about mint jelly was rack of lamb and we were a bit concerned about that.  This was far from the case.  The mint was very subtle and the mango was full of flavor.  A nice way to start our little journey.* Choice of Dessert: Marriage ""Strawberry & Banana"" - Looking at the little masterpiece in front of you, it's as if have a miniature candy showpiece has appeared.  Delicious white chocolate, flecks of gold, fresh berries, banana cream, strawberry sorbet...it's just pretty and yummy to eat.* Choice of Dessert: Apollo ""Chocolate & Raspberry Mousse"" - Another showpiece before your eyes, this time with this wonderful Earl Grey ice cream that rests on top (Oh how I wish I could order a huge bowl of that!).  Little accents like the meringue and the chocolate rice cookie squares were among my faves of the dish.* Petit Four - Chocolate molten cake with marshmallows made from passion fruit and raspberry.  I enjoyed this dessert but this third part was not the favorite of the Husband's.  He really enjoyed the other courses more.One of the best parts about sitting at the counter is watching the actual pastry chef up front and center.  Yes, she's one of the young girls working so hard to make every dessert look absolutely beautiful.  She's straight from Japan, having only arrived in the States a couple of months ago and apparently she's been trained by some of the best.We asked how often they plan on rotating the menu and ultimately, they said they hope to do every week.  But for now, we'll see.  They also hope to have five entrees to choose from in the Choice of Dessert section.We also got a goodie bag with yummy desserts to take home during their opening week, so I got to enjoy Raku all week long at home.We're liking Sweets Raku and it'll be one of those places we recommend and take out-of-town guests.  This kind of experience isn't for everyone as it's quite drawn out and there's a reason they ask, ""How was your experience?"".  (Be sure to experience the restroom too!)  If you aren't into desserts, especially ones that take time and detail, this isn't your place.  They get busy in the later evenings but are slow when they first open in the afternoon.  So come early if you don't want to wait since this place only holds about 20+ diners at a time.",13,10,O0WsPVaVYob7XPB9Z8tmhg,8/15/2013,5,3,76,Restaurant

Andre's has been on my radar for about 4 years now, but I never made it over to MC or to the now closed Downtown location. Some of it was due in part to a lackluster experience at Alize, another Andre venture. I'm excited and happy to say that the experience we had this past trip made me grin and giddy inside. As always, I went online and scoured the website's menu. From past research I knew Andre's offered an off-menu Tasting Menu, any number of courses, basically whatever you can dream up, the Chef will make it happen. A week prior to the trip I emailed Andre's and mentioned the 'must haves' for the evening: -Vitello Tonnato, thinly sliced veal loin, albacore tuna, parmesan cheese, very interesting, unexpected flavor of anchovy. -Blackened Bison Carpaccio, parmesan basket, pickled crimini mushrooms, arugula pesto, the mound of pesto worked perfectly with the bison and I especially enjoyed the puff pastry textural contrast. -Pan-Seared Cold Water Sablefish, miso glaze, caramelized endive, black forbidden rice, basil infused olive oil, learned that this fish is a notch above black cod, beautiful fish and lightly scented with the miso glaze. Superb dish. -Maine Lobster Thermidor, white Mushrooms, tarragon dijon mustard cream sauce, a Andre classic, big thumbs down for me, but the bf enjoyed it, really heavy, the lobster would have been great without being smothered in the creamy mess. -Fig Stuffed Quail, prosciutto wrapped, Roquefort risotto, vincotto, excellent representation of the bird. Perfectly cooked. -Braised Veal Ossobuco Comesquis, risotto milanese, gremolata crust, natural jus, so comforting, robust flavors, but at the same time refined. -Pan Seared Cervana Venison, green asparagus, fingerling potatoes, pomegranate reduction, what a hunk of meat, luscious and delicious to my lips. The rest was at the leisure and discretion of Chef Greg: -Golden Ossetra Caviar,traditional accompaniments, we were offered the last 2 ounces in the restaurant, we went with an ounce, could have EASILY consumed two. Deliciously satisfying, a FANTASTIC way to start a meal. -Chilled Australian Lobster, mango wrapped tail, curried creme fraiche, papaya-serrano pepper salad, from the description on the general menu, I was expecting a dull cold shell-on lobster claw, but the presentation was gorgeous, petite and decidedly unique in flavor profiles. Chef makes his own 'fruit roll-up' to wrap around the lobster. One of the favorites for the evening. -Pan-Seared Foie Gras, caramelized apple, five-spice creme anglaise, port wine reduction, the lightest representation of foie, the richness was expertly cut w/a well thought out contrasting ingredients. -Free-Range Chicken Seared foie gras, tomato, cauliflower croquette, roasted chicken jus, OMG, BEST chicken EVER. I never would have picked this, b/c I try to stay away from chicken in restos, but this was so flavorful, so juicy, I wanted to save some in my cheeks for later. Desserts: There was a trio, which I don't remember, but captured by a photo and a lovely vanilla/choc souffle, perfect sugar dusted crust. The Sommelier is Italian and quite gregarious in nature. Thoroughly enjoyed all his selections to pair with our 14-course journey. Warning for the lightweights: pours are GENEROUS. All the elements Chef Greg lovingly prepared on each dish worked harmoniously together. Wonderful sauces graced each dish and married well with the centerpiece of the course. Old favorites that are staples of fine dining were presented in ways that were innovative. Chef Greg brings a youthful vibrancy to French food in LV. His passion was evident during his numerous visits to see how we were enjoying the meal and at the end of the meal he sat down at our booth to shoot the breeze for a good ten minutes. Make time for this meal, it took us FOUR hours. Extras: Menu is printed with the name of the guest who made the reservation. Love to have a reference point during the evening. Got a tour of the kitchen and met Chef Greg's newest recruit from Nobu LV. With a gorgeous remodelled interior, the established resto has taken a new culinary vision and is better for it!!! This dining experience at Andre's ranks as Number TWO on my Vegas Short List.",8,8,oO8ferAjuNqbLpz73-DdLg,4/23/2009,5,2,80,Restaurant

Make sure you are ON TIME, we were in the cab at 6:04PM and got a call. Eeks.The service is a one man show.  He is energetic, efficient, will keep you updated on delays and hovers a bit.  Ambiance is intimate and VERY quiet, don't even remember if there was music, but we felt like we had to whisper even in our large booth.  Dxc3xa9cor is kind of 90s, white with black marble and beaded drapes.  Kimonos are displayed throughout.Toilets are awesome, heated Japanese toilets with all the bootie cleaning bells and whistles.TRUE sadness, their liquor license is still pending for about 6 more months, SO they only serve non-alcoholic drinks.  They comped two glasses of 'champagne' for us.  There are four menus to choose from, one is for repeat guests, so we were not able to choose this time around.  We opted for Omakase 4: Signature, 7 courses and has more of a French spin to the dishes.C1: Warm Appetizer, Clam, Crab, Seaweed and Mochi, seems simple, but was so delicate and fragrant, the crab was reconstructed, so soft and luscious.  C2: Ama-ebi Tar-Tar, citris sorbet, caviar and a peach cream, sounds really odd, but somehow worked harmoniously togetherC3: Steamed dish: foie gras and duck, amazing, who knew fresh wasabi could catapult a dish like this?!?C4: Fish from Tsukiji, this course was so beautifully presented, blew us away.  Ika, Ikura, uni, crab, clams, snapper, different types of ginger, soy beans, plums, knotted ribbon like mochi and salted fish, reminded me of the Chinese version in fried rice, SO good.  We even got to brush and season our fish!  C5: Simmered fish, buttery, lovely silken tofu, reminded me of a really elegant claypot type dish, scallions were cut with precision and balanced the richness of the dishC6: Grilled Wagyu A5 beef, on the leaner side of the spectrum, so tender, all the natural flavors coming through, loved the wasabi mash and the bamboo shoots, I don't typically like bamboo, but they really take care to ensure they are cooked and seasoned properly here.  C7: Desserts, Asian pear, red bean and chestnut, so simple, fresh and wonderful.  The tiramisu was also good, but my favorite was the red bean.The A5 comes out with a birth certificate.  This was SO entertaining.  We literally talked about this the rest of the night.  According to their website, not only do they get their fish from Tsukiji, they have their own fish buyer.  Every fish course was top notch.Special: the server explained fresh wasabi and the shark skin grater and even let me grate and taste my product!  Never been to a fine dining establishment who uses Square payment.  So progressive!  Such exciting food and techniques!  Memorable and wonderful.

The dining room was mod, Jetson-esque, breathtaking and swank.  I was impressed by the carefully strung glass globes and the white domed booths.  I felt like I was on another planet.  The food is not cheap here.  To balance out the prices, the portioning is quite large.  An entree is definitely enough to satiate one's hunger.  The bread basket is pretty impressive, with 5 types of bread, but sadly, most were chewy and cold.  The only one I enjoyed was the salty bread, which was similar to a croissant, nice and flaky.  The butter had an interesting twist, bits of peanut in the butter and also served was the standard plain version.  Chef sent out an amuse to start our evening: a compilation of prosciutto, fig, Parmesan, and balsamic glaze.  The other components set off the sweetness of the grilled fig.Normally the compliment of the Chef is a BITE, this one was a few bites, so I knew we had made the right choice not to order an appetizer, to save room for the main event and DESSERT!The menu is extensive, catering to both the conservative and adventurous eater.  I chose the Bison Tenderloin.  I would order this ten times out of ten over cow.  Lean, moist, tender, full of natural flavor, and ZERO gaminess.  It tasted like REALLY good COW.  Yum.  Came with a side of veggies, all of which were grilled and seasoned perfectly.  It's important to have veggies FREE on the side.  My compadres had:Thai Snapper, standard, rice was excellent, but the fish was salty.Duck, above average, but nothing special.Roasted Maine Lobster, EXCELLENT, great contrasting textures and flavors.Shared Side:Elbow pasta, black truffle, ham, gruyre cheese-DELICIOUS, a bread crumb crust would have put it over the top.The pastry chef has numerous accolades for his creations.  We were not shy about ordering:Chocolate dome, mango chutney, passion fruit sorbet, a bit rich for my taste, but everyone else devoured it.Chocolate Tea Tart, beautiful presentation, perfect for dark choc lovers.Rhubarb coconut, light and the rhubarb was a nice departure from the standard fruit selections.At the end of the meal fresh madelines are presented to the table, we were stuffed, but all of us managed to fit the buttery morsel into our mouths.  Nutella is provided with the sweet treat.  The BEST madeline I've had in my life, slightly sweet, right out of the oven, and crisp edges.  After dinner we wanted to check out the famed lounge.  From the stark white of the dining room, to dark chocolates and reds, we were transported once again.

We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff and sharing.  Yes, I was the birthday girl, but I did manage to snag a copy of our receipt.  This is what it looked like:-Meris King Crab App - $24-Asparagus - $9-Rst Mushrooms - $10-Ketel One Martini $13-Chopped Salad - $9-Chilean Sea Bass - $$35-G_Manifesto (J's glass of wine) - $12-12 ox Meyers NY Strip - $30----------------------------------------Total before tip - $152.21I loved loved loved the chopped salad... lots of chopped up veggies and the perfect amount of Champagne vinaigrette.  And the beautiful thing about sharing at Modern Steak is that they split everything in the kitchen... and the portion sizes were still quite generous.  The king crab app is served warm and is melt in your mouth delicious but it literally comes in a jar full of a butter sauce so be forewarned.  The mushroom and asparagus sides were amazing also.  I honestly enjoyed every bite! In addition to what is listed on the bill, we enjoyed fresh baked potato and parmesan herb bread... delicious!  And the sea bass was fantastic and the steak was perfectly done per our request.  We skipped desert but ended up having another drink in the bar with friends.What a perfect way to celebrate my birthday!This will for sure be a go-to place for special occasions in the future.

The fresh bread was better than I remembered from our previous visit.  I started with the wedge salad (and so did my dad and brother).  We were all extremely pleased as the salads were chilled just right, the lettuce was fresh and crisp, and had the perfect balance of tomato, crispy bacon, and blue cheese dressing.  We also shared some appetizers for the table including Crispy Calamari, Parmesan Risotto, and Warm Beets.I went with the Crab Cake for my entree... much better than the sea bass I had previously during my first visit.  Served with avocado, cucumber, and a sweet sauce, the serving size was plenty, and it was delicious!  The texture was crispy on the outside, and warm and creamy on the inside.  I also dug into the sides that we shared at the table including asparagus, creamed spinach, roasted mushrooms, and french fries that came with the burgers... (my mom, J, and Z had burgers).  My dad really enjoyed his Veal Porterhouse.  And as if we weren't full enough, we shared a few desserts.  My favorite was still the Carrot Cake and everyone else loved the Apple Tart.And as I'm typing this review, I'm smiling just thinking about what a memorable night we had at J & G... I'm really happy we gave them another shot!  The other funny thing I'm smiling about is that I just wrote about the menu items we had and that I would recommend, and I think they are getting ready to change their menu... we were told they do so on a quarterly basis.  I just hope that the new Spring menu is as good if not better than the one we had on Friday.  And I hope that our future visits will continue to be five stars as well.  As the saying goes, ""you never get a second chance to make a first impression,"" but in this case, I'm glad we gave J & G a second chance - and I bet they are too... after all, I'm bumping my rating up from three stars to five!

The patio is comfortable and now that the weather is cooling down, I'm sure it will become a local favorite for hot spot outdoor dining.  Jerry, our server, took great care of us.  As we perused the menu, we noticed that everything is reasonably priced, and although I'm typically not a huge fan of French cuisine, there were a handful of items that were appealing to me.  Jerry brought us fresh warm rolls that had tasty herbs baked into them.  I usually skip the bread basket but I make exceptions for 'special' occasions and this was one of them - each bite was delightful!Just as we finished up our rolls, our Salade Maison was served (we ordered one to share).  Described as crispy chevre, lardons, candied walnuts, peppery greens and roasted shallot vinaigrette, (and I noticed it also had dill in it which I love); the salad was delicious and perfectly balanced with sweet and salty flavors and just the right amount of dressing. It was large enough to share, and priced right at $7.Next, I had the Coquille Saint-Jacques (sea scallops appetizer priced at a moderate $8) and a side of asparagus and Jared enjoyed the Poulet Roti (roasted stuffed chicken entree - $15).  We both cleaned our plates after admiring the beautiful presentations.Adding to the ambiance was the spot on French music (including French renditions of songs we all know) - props to Wendy for that! I'm totally in wedding mode at the moment so perhaps I fell hard for Petite Maison because of that alone; it was a memorable romantic meal that I shared with my fiance afterall...  but I'm pretty sure that Petite Maison will become a regular in our rotation - can't wait to try it for breakfast, brunch, and lunch too!",16,14,BAiqukghrqt_QLBw8H-_ZA,10/7/2009,5,13,61,Restaurant

The service, atmosphere, wine, and food were all pretty good.  Michelina herself even came by the table to check on us.  However, for $50 per person, I believe we deserved to be blown away!  We were satisfied, but not blown away...It was a rainy Friday night, and my boyfriend was craving Italian as was the other couple we went out with... They relied on me to choose the restaurant, so I remembered that I enjoyed Michelina's a few months back with some family that was in from out-of-town.  (Please note that I never saw the bill that last time and had no clue how expensive everything was during that visit.)  There were no Yelp reviews yet, so even more appealing, right?  I could be the first!  So, here it goes:Michelina's is hiding in a very unassuming little shopping center off of Shea and the 51.  I would guess that their business is mostly from word-of-mouth because I'd never noticed the location before my first visit nor had I heard of it!  I made a reservation to be safe, but I don't know if we really needed it or not.  Brad was our server and he was excellent.  He took drink orders and recommended 2 appetizer specials:  Eggplant rollatini and Oysters with spinach, ricotta, and bay shrimp in an alfredo sauce.  We took one of each for the table.  Brad commented that we could wait to see if we liked the apps to know if we could trust him or not.  We did trust him - we were all pleased with the appetizers even though I thought the Oysters were a bit heavy.We went with a bottle of Merlot for the table (I don't remember the name of it) and it was good - nothing special, but good.  For our entrees, I went with the escolar special - served on a bed of sauteed spinach; Jared went with the Veal Chop special served with fresh pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta; Deborah took Brad's advice and ordered the Chicken Genovese special; and Jack had the Veal Saltimbocca layered with prosciutto and mozzarella cheese.  (More on entrees coming soon...)This is where the highlight of the meal came in... we were all pleasantly surprised that dinner salads came with our entrees.  There was no mention of this on the menu, so when Brad brought out the salad course, it was an added bonus!  The house dressing was delicious and the salads were basic but fresh and delicious!Back to the entrees... Jared was the most pleased with his (the Veal Chop with fresh shells) - he said it was excellent!  We all had meal envy because the rest of the entrees were kind of bleh - not Worth the $25/$30 for each of them.  Jack and Deborah mentioned after that perhaps our meals would have been better if Michelina added about a cup less salt to each of them!We opted against dessert, but the boys had some coffee/cappuccino and Brad brought us all out a complimentary apertif of amaretto, creme de menthe, and creme de cacao... I don't think any of us were interested, but it was a sweet (literally sweet) gesture.We all left feeling satisfied but not blown away... We won't be rushing back to visit Michelina anytime soon, but if money is not an issue, go check it out and let me know what you think.  Maybe your experience will be worth more than 3 stars!",10,4,5kCdbuIdIaldrdFnog9w5w,12/1/2007,3,0,61,Restaurant

I'd heard of Tossed before (maybe because it was voted ""NYC's best salad"" by New York Magazine.) Or, maybe because my friend opened a similar concept called Dressed in Atlanta... either way, I'm the kind of girl that loves a big salad for lunch, and I'm psyched to have a place like tossed here in Arizona...As of today, October 10, Tossed has been open just over a week. So I know I can't be too tough on them... when we went a few days ago, they were still getting used to being open. Even so, it was a positive experience.  The space itself is pretty large for a salad restaurant.  I think it used to be an Arizona Bread Company - I hope it does well at this location as I'd love for it to stay!I was with my brother; I asked if he'd join me for lunch at tossed since I really wanted to try it.  We walked in and figured out to go to the side that was to order in (as the other side was for catering and take out orders) - it was kind of confusing, but we later learned (from Gazwan Paulus, the Area Developer) that bigger signs are on their way.Since I'd picked up one of the tossed menus before we went, we both were somewhat familiar with it, but it still took me a few minutes at the register to design my own salad from their huge list of ingredients.  Zack chose from the list of ""specialty salads and creative interpretations of familiar favorites"" and ordered the Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad.  I finally chose my unique combo of greens, chick peas, chopped tomato, avocado, turkey, and maybe celery.  I also suggested to Zack that we order one of their whole wheat crepes (that are made fresh in the store to create crepe wrap sandwiches) to share.  After we ordered and payed, we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept.  However, it was not until after we ordered that we were able to actually see all of the ingredients in front of us - I may have chose differently after seeing everything laid out in front of me...Regardless, it was only a matter of minutes before  our beautiful salads were delivered to us.  Presentation was beautiful, service was friendly, and best of all, our salads were delicious!  I'd taken the suggestion from Tori (the girl who took our order) to taste the Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette as my dressing and it was delicious - Thanks again, Tori!  We were both pleased with what we ordered; the crepes were a light, chewy, unique texture that we both really enjoyed as well.  Somehow a bite or two of cheese made it into my salad which isn't the end of the world, but I knew I hadn't ordered it- I'll let it go since they are still so new.There are a ton of other salads that I look forward to designing at tossed and I cannot wait to go back for more!  You may want to check it out online before you go as the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Prices range from $6.95 - $10.95 but can get even more expensive if you like to add a ton of ingredients.  I'd plan on spending about $10 per person on average.  Not so bad... oh, and they also soup, smoothies, and sweet treats including freshly baked cookies, brownies, and fruit - there is something for everyone.As we were leaving, we met the Area Developer I spoke of above and he was really nice... he wanted to make sure we had a good experience and he told us of their plans to build locations of tossed all around the Valley.  I hope they will consider coming to Old Town because that's where I'll be soon!",18,13,z9E5obU8LUVeCpQCVcA5Hg,10/10/2008,4,4,61,Restaurant

EVER!It was a Wednesday night and we had 8:00 reservations.  We walked in right on time and were greeted immediately by none other than Eliot Wexler, himself. He couldn't have been friendlier, seating us immediately (just the way it should be when you have a reservation)! I noticed that the restaurant was packed and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves - that was a good sign!  Plus the fact that I bumped into Jenn H, and I know she's got good taste, so when she recommended a few of her favorite menu items, I listened!There were 3 of us dining, and I know we all enjoyed every moment, every sip, and every bite!  We each had a glass of wine to start - I went with the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc.  Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to order - everything sounded unique and appealing.  After asking our waiter, Robert, for his opinion, I flagged Eliot down to ask what he thought between the Skate Wing and the Scallops.  He sold me on the Skate Wing... and I would order it again and again!  But before I get there, I have to mention that the table sampled the Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup... (a special treat that was not on the menu).  We also tasted the Spinach Mezzaluna - a handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, mascarpone, and pecorino.  It was incredible!  I truly savored each bite! Oh, and how can I forget the fresh bread and olive oil brought to our table?  Truly, the freshest tasting olive oil... I'm not kidding!On to the entrees... (pictured above).  My companions fancied their scallops and halibut immensely.  We traded a bite for a bite so we could each try all three entrees too, and they were all pretty amazing.  I will say, however, that Eliot (and Jenn H) steered me right in suggesting the Skate Wing.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!We were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal... so, what did we do?  On top of the cotton candy, we shared the donuts and the apple risotto.  We may as well do it right, right?  Wow!  We sure did do it right... the donut holes were served with 3 dipping sauces, and while I'm not a donut person, these were pretty amazing.  I hadn't treated myself to Cotton Candy since I was a little girl, so that was a fun addition of sugar shot right into my system... you have to have some, it's their signature dessert!  Finally, we went for one more indulgence... the apple risotto - oh, the apple risotto.  Fantastic!  Tiny pieces of apple sauteed with butter, sugar, honey, and more... topped with a salty butter flavored ice cream.  I know there were some additional ingredients that I'm missing here, but OMG... need I say more?In some of the press I've read about this place, it's referred to as ""fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price."" I would agree with that - although I do think the 'accessible price' part is relative.  I would consider this more of a 'special occasion' type of place because of the $$ you'll spend here - $50 pp more or less.  It's worth dumping out your piggy bank if you have to though... it's a culinary experience you won't forget!I'm already dreaming about my next visit!",22,16,tD6wkhFDoDoggYf7kiDoZA,11/26/2008,5,7,59,Restaurant

Sure, it's expensive, but I've never had a bad meal (or drink) there.  But, I took an unintentional hiatus from Ocean Club when I got married and had a baby, and what do you know, at least two years have passed... So when it was time to choose a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday dinner this past Saturday, Ocean Club it was, and once again, I was reminded how fabulous it is!  While I used to sit in the bar (where there is great people watching including plenty of ""hired help,"" awesome bartenders, and live music), we had the baby with us and a party of five, so we were seated in a back corner... this was totally fine by the way.  They had a highchair for the baby and everything!  Tyler was our waiter and he was great... the rest of the staff was extremely attentive as well.  My husband, mom, and I went with dirty martinis, and my dad and brother went the bloody mary route.  We were all pleased with the drinks - as mentioned in other reviews, they are indeed pricey, but you get two drinks in one!Bread bowl - this is worth mentioning as they always have a nice selection of breads and crackers including my favorite: pretzel bread... yum!Appetizers at our table included two types of oysters, a lobster sushi roll, salads, and calamari.  Hint: ask to split their salads - they are still a decent size when split.  I love their ""Ocean Club House salad"" - It could possibly be a meal in itself as it has crisp lettuce, fresh shrimp, egg, blue cheese, tomato, and onion.  The other apps were delicious too.For my entree, I split the Chilean Sea Bass with my husband... I'm a huge sea bass fan and this is up with there with some of the best I've had.  Again, splitting it is great as even a half serving is plenty once you add family style sides, etc...  My parents went with lobster tail and brother had a bone-in ribeye.  We chose the roasted brussel sprouts and signature lobster mashed potatoes (both cooked perfectly and oh so delicious as well).  Note that it's very difficult to choose just a few sides as there are so many to choose from and they are all delicious.  The sweet potato fries, onion rings, creamed spinach, and steamed broccoli are other faves that I've had in the past.  As if any of us weren't full enough, Tyler brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake for the birthday girl, served with fresh whipped cream.  Mmmmm.... and once we licked that plate clean, we also ordered their signature butter cake, which came with more fresh whipped cream.  OMG - that butter cake is incredible!We all went home full and happy and will definitely return for more special occasions.

It was a great idea, and I'm not sure why I didn't think of it on my own.  I took it and ran with it and headed to Rita's with Lindsey D.  Rita's was awesome for breakfast that day... we both found great parking spots and walked right in.  There was not a wait and the weather was perfect for us to dine alfresco.  Service was top notch and food was fabulous too!  And the best thing? They didn't seem to mind that we stayed after our meal to take advantage of their free wifi to work for a bit!  So why only three stars, you might be wondering?  Well, I had such a wonderful breakfast that day, that I ended up suggesting Rita's for a group dinner the following week, and I've since been back two more times; once for lunch and another time for dinner with my husband.  After those three additional visits, I can say that I still recommend Rita's for the following:*breakfast*drinks alfresco with a fabulous view*chips and tableside prepared guacamole*lunch if you don't mind paying a premium for the setting*a kid friendly environment*live music in the evenings 7 days a weekI find that while breakfast at Rita's is reasonably priced, lunch and dinner can get pricey and the food is really nothing to write home about.  I had a salad for lunch, a fish entree for one dinner, and the chicken tortilla soup at the other dinner.  I also sampled my husband's chicken wings and chicken entree.  If you go for lunch or dinner, Rita's Chopped Salad is tasty, but the entree portion is small... so is the starter portion, but I expected that from a starter.  I do not recommend the chicken tortilla soup, chicken wings, halibut, or chicken entree.  I'd probably go for a burger or tacos if I end up at Rita's for dinner in the future.If you care less about food quality and more about convenience, ambiance, the ability to reserve a table for a group, and/or a place that is kid-friendly... don't hesitate to head to Rita's.  I am indeed a fan of this local resort gem for the entire experience (save for some of the aforementioned menu items).  I'm sure I'll head back (likely for breakfast), but won't be rushing to Rita's for lunch or dinner anytime too soon.",5,3,p8Zh8QWVXm9ygMC-56cJVQ,4/21/2014,3,1,57,Restaurant

The staff was attentive and friendly - Alan was our server and took great care of us.  We started with  a glass of prosecco each and decided to share the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and the shrimp pie.  Sounds like a ton of food, but it was perfect for the two of us.  I eat a lot - especially of veggies, and I love that HP has a large selection when it comes to veggies and salads... I have to return soon to try the butternut squash and the veggie salad (both sounded great to me).I'll preface this by saying, I like the flavor of burnt food.  So, the fact that the brussel sprouts were a tad bit overdone, was fine with me... although for other patrons, it may not be so appealing.  The cauliflower was not burnt, but it didn't have so much flavor either.  Regardless, I wanted to get my vegetables in for the day, and they seemed fresh despite the way they were cooked.  Does that make sense?As some of the yelpers before me commented, we noticed the use of lemon zest in our shrimp pie.  It was light on the shrimp, sauce, and cheese, but it did have a zesty flavor to it.  I added some chili pepper flakes and parmesan as well... mmmm.As if I hadn't eaten enough food, Christina requested a small sample of the olive oil gelato so I could taste it... and I actually enjoyed it!  If you're open to trying something new, the olive oil gelato is the perfect sweet ending to your meal at Humble Pie.My 4 star rating is for my overall experience at Humble Pie - I was in fantastic company, a casual environment (which I love), and lots of veggie options to choose from... the pizza was fine - I'll try another selection next visit.I also noticed that there is plenty of bar seating for those that like to sit at the bar, hang with the bartender, etc... good to know in case I ever return solo!

The steak was tender and well-seasoned, the cod was sweet, and the sea bass was herby and refreshing.  The green beans were a nice base to the meal, and the crispy sprouts were oily and salty - a great contrast to everything else.Upon leaving we used the restroom, and the only available stall was broken.  Pardon the visual, but my friend and I both peed into a toilet that didn't flush, so we were just adding our touches to what everyone else left behind.  Yum!The restaurant is also right next door to Surrender, so it's super convenient if that's your next destination.  We went over to XS, but it wasn't that far of a walk.",5,4,EGQWqQ4gg5BZlFvB1UdupA,1/30/2016,4,3,33,Restaurant

We came in after seeing burger and chicken sandwich pictures on Yelp, but when we arrived, none of that was on the menu. I mentioned this to our server, and she said that they just switched to dinner (so early!), but she could probably get those two things out to us if we wanted. We did want, and that's what we got. Before figuring this out, however, we ordered a few appetizers that we couldn't cancel. We got the lump crab lettuce wraps and the meatball slider (with mozzarella instead of ricotta). The crab wraps were okay, but very salty. I probably wouldn't order again. The slider was a meatball slider. Nothing interesting or fancy. I could have done without both of these.We also got some drinks off the happy hour menu. I tried the blood orange fizz and the mojito with the weirdly spelled name. Moscito? Both were good.

I've never had one quite so soft, airy, and fluffy.  It was like eating a cloud and put all other souffles I've had to shame.  Actually, in retrospect, I can't say I've ever had a proper souffle, now that I know what they're supposed to be like.The rest of the meal was very good, but not outstanding.  My duck was a little dry.  The sea bass was nicely done.  I don't remember much else.  On that note, I'd probably rate the food a 4 or a 4.5.  The risotto and souffle were 10's, so that evens out to 5 overall.  Regardless, service was impeccable.  We were waited on hand and foot and made to feel as though we were the only two in the restaurant.  Every dish was explained, from ingredients to eating etiquette, and there was just the perfect amount of personal conversation to make it seem as though we were all friends and that the staff really cared about who we were.  Immaculate!  I've never had such service!  They even matched our dinner napkins to our clothing colors!  So crazy!It was a lovely (albeit pricey) birthday dinner from the boyfriend!

I have no shame, I LOVE MY MEAT!I've been to Del Frisco's, Delmonico's, Craftsteak and Mon Ami Gabi and I can say hands-down that CUT blew these highly rated Vegas Steakhouses OUT OF THE WATER!On Thursday, 7.29.10, my friend and I arrived on time for our 6 PM reservations and were promptly seated. FOOD/DRINKS:*2007 Pinot Noir ($17/glass): I forgot the name b/c it's not listed on their online menu, but this Pinot was recommended by our waitress. It had the perfect balance of berry flavor w/ a slight acidity to balance the richness of the food.*Complimentary Bread:-Cheese sticks: OMG! The cheese sticks were sprinkled w/ parmesan cheese and baked to a cheesy crisp. -Pretzel Bread: SO GOOD! Nice and crusty on the outside and pillow soft layers in the inside.-Onion Focaccia: YUM! It was like layers of buttery bread woven around sweet caramelized onions*Bone Marrow Flan ($17): YUM! What a genius take on bone marrow! The flan was like velvety smooth custard w/ prominent bone marrow flavor (beefy richness) w/o an overwhelming oiliness that bone marrow tends to have. The mushroom marmalade added a layer of savory sweetness while the warm toasted added a nice crunch.*Maple Glazed Pork Belly ($17): MmMm! The pork belly was perfectly crisp and smokey on the outside and fork tender and soft in the inside. The pear compote added the perfect amount of sweetness to balance to saltiness from the pork, while the dressed arugula added a layer of citrusy peppery freshness. *A Tasting of New York Sirloin ($145 + $40 for an add'l 2 oz): Shared among 2 people.Before we ordered, the steaks were beautifully presented on a platter while our waitress explained the differences (i.e. marbling). All the steaks are lightly seasoned w/ their House Sea Salt, charred to seal in the juices, and then grilled to the perfect tenderness. Each cut was served w/ an accompanying sauce chosen by the Chef. -Australian Waygu Sirloin (2 oz): OMFG *Faint*! This was BEST effen steak I've ever had in my 28 years! With gentle strokes from my knife, the AW cut like a piece of butter and juices dribbled down from the pores of the meat. The AW had a crisp crust and the meat melted in my mouth like a triple cream butter. It was so full of FLAVOR from the intense marbling and it wasn't overly seasoned so you can taste the actual waygu.Bearnaise: Added an add'l layer of richness w/ a hint of citrus flavor-U.S.D.A. PRIME Dry Aged Nebraska (4 oz): SO GOOD! It's a little leaner than the AW, however, the taste is not sacrificed. Just like the AW, the steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare) w/ crisp outer crust and juicy tender center. Chimichurri: Added an herby freshness w/ a touch of sweetness-American Waygu from Idaho (4 oz): Although it was a perfectly cooked and seasoned steak, it was my least favorite of the three. This is to be expected after sampling the other steaks which had much more marbling and flavor. House made Steak Sauce: Added a sweet and spicy tang*Sides:-Bone Marrow ($9): OMFG! As you bite into the gobbles of marrow, the beefy oily goodness just bursts in your mouth and showers your cut of meat w/ yet another layer of richness.-Creamed Spinach w/ Fried Egg ($12): YUM! The spinach was tender and the yolk from the egg added the perfect amount of creaminess w/o being too heavy.*Strawberry Shortcake ($14): The perfect ending to our meal! The shortcake was warm and crisp on the outside w/ soft layers in the inside. The vanilla ice cream added a sweet richness while the strawberry frozen yogurt added a tart sweetness. It was the perfect balance of taste, textures, and temperatures; hot, cold, creamy, sweet, and tart.*Complementary Dessert:-Salted Carmel Fudge Bar: After stuffing myself w/ rich laden foods, the richness of the fudge was just too overwhelming for me.-Whiskey Cashew Brittle: OMG! The cashew was perfectly toasted and crisp, while the brittle was sweet and crunchy w/ a hint of the whiskey. What set it over the top was the flakey, buttery phyllo dough crust.SERVICE:FLAWLESS! Our waitress was friendly and very attentive. She was well-versed w/ the menu and made excellent recommendations. Orders were promptly taken and the food was brought out like an orchestrated symphony. The other wait staff looked like intimidating nightclub bouncers but were very sweet and checked on us numerous times to make sure everything was perfect. AMBIANCE/Dxc3x89COR:CUT is not your grandpa's steakhouse. It's modern and sleek w/ ivory basket woven walls, glass square box lighting, abstract gun metal dxc3xa9cor and black/white scenic pictures.CUT is a MUST go-to for steak connoisseurs! It's not cheap, however, a meal at CUT is one of those ""life experiences"" that you cannot put a price tag on...",14,9,UVAwr9_8QOCFR0FFiln2Pw,8/3/2010,5,9,105,Restaurant

Ever since trying the Australian Wagyu at CUT (Palazzo) last year, NO steak has ever compared until recently. I'm in NO way comparing a USDA Steak to Wagyu b/c wagyu is on a whole other caliber w/ its intense richness from the marbling. However, for the price and quality, Mon Ami Gabi served THE BEST FILET MIGNON I've ever had in my life!On Friday, 2/18/11, my friends and I came to MAG for dinner (this was my 2nd visit). Our party of 7 had reservations for 8 PM. We wanted to sit at the outdoor patio but there's a 40 min wait b/c it's a ""First Come, First Serve"" for patio seating (even w/ reservations). We waited for about 25 mins before being seated at the patio. F O O D*CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE w/ Burgundy Red Wine Mustard ($9.95): OMG, one of the best, if not THE BEST pate I've ever had!The pate was so smooth that it spread like a fine triple cream butter on the warm country toast. As you bit into the bread, you get a toasty crispness followed by the rich velvety savoryness from the pate. The sweet and tangy red wine mustard nicely balanced out the richness of the pate and brought together the entire app.*WARM BRIE CHEESE w/ Black Pepper Honey & Hazelnuts ($10.95): MOUTH-WATERING!One cut into the rind and the warm brie OOZED out like lava. Slather the melted brie on the accompanying toasted croutons w/ a little black pepper honey and bits of hazelnut and you get the perfect texture contrast of crisp and soft and flavor combos of creamy, buttery, savory, earthy, nutty w/ a mild pungency, tang, and spice. It was definitely a tantalizing experience for your taste buds. *FILET MIGNON ROQUEFORT - Special Request ($31.95): THE BEST FILET I'VE EVER HAD!I requested the 8 oz filet cooked medium rare. As I started to cut my filet, I noticed it took minimal effort as the steak cut like butter which is always a good indicator of a good steak. It was perfectly seared to a medium rare w/ a warm pink center. I took the first bite w/o the bleu cheese sauce and the steak was perfectly seasoned; just enough to bring out the natural beefy flavor of the filet. A gentle slather of the bleu cheese sauce added a creamy pungency that gave the steak a ""bite"" to it while the arugula gave a pop of bitterness to help round out the richness. With each chew, the juice oozed out from the fibers and the filet was so soft and tender that it literally melted like butter in my mouth (similar to a fine wagyu minus the richness).The accompanying frites were like lightly salted sliced chips and were addicting to say the least. I ate it w/ the filet to give it a crispy texture contrast and we each saved some for some drunken morning eats. The frites did hold up its crispy texture until the next morning.*GARLIC SPINACH ($6.95): GOOD!The spinach was perfectly cook which was indicated by its vibrant green color. It was soft w/ a slight bite to it and very garlicky. The slight bitterness was the perfect accompaniment to our rich meal.V A L U EFor a French Steakhouse on the Vegas Strip, MAG is very affordable.   We ordered 4 apps to share (we also ordered the mussels and crab cakes which I didn't try) and each person had their own entrxc3xa9e and our bill was ONLY $40/person including tax and tip! That's even cheaper than my dinner last night at a Chinese restaurant in SF's Chinatown!S E R V I C EFriendly, but lacks organization and efficiency.When it started raining, patrons sitting outside started running in. We asked our waiter if we could sit inside.  He said in a condescending tone, ""You'll have to ask the Manager."" Seriously, WTF?!?! If it was in the forecast that it was going to rain, WHY would you let patrons dine outside w/o any back up plan in the first place? One of my friends talked to the manager and he did find us a table in 5 mins which was a redeeming factor.Our second waiter was friendly and attentive, although it took over 15 mins to get the bread. Despite this, our apps did come out several mins upon receiving the bread and our entrees 5 mins upon finishing our apps. She also checked on us several times to make sure we were doing ok.A M B I A N C E / D xc3x89 C O RMAG is a very spacious and charming French Bistro. It's has a classy feel w/o being pretentious. The large indoor dining area has multiple rooms and the outdoor patio sets the stage for the perfect scenic brunch or dinner as you get views of the Bellagio Fountain Water Show across the street and the glitzy night lights of the Vegas Strip.When it comes to Vegas, I'm all about ""Go Big OR Go Home"", however w/ MAG, there is NO need to. MAG serves delectable classic French at a fraction of the cost of upscale Restaurant on the Strip w/o sacrificing quality and ambiance. Come to MAG and use the $$$ you save here for gambling, shopping or in my case, GOOSE which is NO surprise to those that know me...",10,6,ifVVRkNiWQOr6G1kaMZ4aA,2/24/2011,5,6,88,Restaurant

If it weren't for both the terrible service and drinks it would have been 5 stars.After reading some of the so-so reviews on Yelp, me and my bf didn't have high expectations of Social House, but we were ""WOWED"" by the food. Considering it's an Asian Fusion restaurant, the dishes far surpassed the ones we had at Okada at The Wynn and Sushi Roku at Caesar's Palace...This was the first place we hit up after our flight landed on Friday, 12/5. We arrived at 10:30 PM for our reservations and were seated promptly. The dxc3xa9cor was trendy and upbeat. I would not expect anything less for an upscale LV restaurant. What stood out the most was the wall filled with gold drawers by the staircase, which was reminiscent of the drawers you would find in a Chinese Herb store. The patio overlooks the TI Pirate Show--the perfect place to sit if the weather was hot. The only complaint I had was the tables were too close too each other, so you can hear your neighbor's entire conversation and they can hear yours. The restaurant was not busy at this time, but it took about 10-15 minutes, for our server, Danny/Donnie (?) to even show up. But, more on that later.On to the food and drinks...COCKTAILS: *Green Tea Lemonade: Gross, it was very bitter and hard to drink.*Ginger Saketini: Even worse. It was super sweet and you couldn't taste the alcohol. It was so sweet that it was like drinking syrup.FOOD:*Yellowtail with Crispy Jalapexc3xb1os: EXCELLENT; the BEST SASHIMI EVER. The yellowtail was fresh and melted in your mouth. The warm tempura battered jalapexc3xb1o was a perfect compliment to the yellowtail. A big thanks to the Yelpers out there who recommended this dish!*Kobe Sliders: EXCELLENT. Yes, it's expensive ($24) for three white castle sized burgers with tempura battered onion rings, but well worth it. The kobe was tender and melted in your mouth. That in between the slightly sweet toasted bun and ponzu (?) mayo was an AMAZING combination. The onion rings were light and crispy, not too oily. *Uni with Quail Egg: OMG GOOD! The uni was massive and incredibly fresh. The quail egg on top of that was buttery heaven. I always judge a restaurant by the quality of their Uni. And, Social House's Uni is definitely one of the best we've ever tasted. For about $10/piece, I guess it better be. :)*Hamachi Roll: Very Good; it was fresh and buttery and paired very well with the garlic chips and citrus soy. It also had a nice kick to it.*Shrimp Spicy Tuna Battera Roll: Ehh, could have passed on this one. This roll was topped with cooked shrimp and filled with spicy tuna that was NOT spicy. It was very bland.*Carrot Cardamon Cake with Pistachio Ice Cream: OMFG--One word that best describes this dessert to a ""T"": is ORGASMIC!!! This is ABSOLUTELTY THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD. The carrot cake came out warm, crisp on the outside, and was topped with toasted carrots, alongside cream cheese fraiche. Once you cut into it, you find yourself with an incredibly moist, light, and flavorful cake. One spoonful of the cake, a little of the cream cheese fraiche and a sprinkle of the toasted carrots with a tiny scoop of the pistachio ice cream carrot=ORGASM in your mouth. The flavors went very well together and the different textures (crunchy, warm, rich) were AMAZING.  The pistachio ice cream was OoOoo La La; this was the richest ice cream I've ever tasted! SERVICE: Needs a major overhaul. From start to finish, the service was terrible. This should have been an indication when entering Social House, and we were faced with 3 zombie-like hostesses. My bf and I are not high maintenance; we order and eat quickly, clean up after ourselves, and leave right afterwards. So, when it comes to service, all I ask is to get nicely greet with a smile, promptly take our orders, and check on us just once. We got none of the above from Danny/Donnie (?), our server. He was no where to be found for the first 10-15 minutes (it was not busy at the time). When he did come, Danny/Donnie had  an expression on his face that read: ""F***, it's Friday Night and I don't want to be here. And, since I'm miserable, I might as well let everyone else feel the same way"" look on his face. C'mon dude, this is you job; I've done retail for 4 years, and the least you can do is ""fake"" it. After he took our orders, we didn't see him for the rest of the night. Apparently, we weren't the only ones who felt this way. The table next to us who also had Danny/Donnie said he was not deserving of any tip. The rest of the staff is just like him; young, snooty, and arrogant (except for the bus boys). Geez, people--does it hurt to crack a smile?!?!?! Hopefully, when we come back again in the Summer (and we'll definitely be back for the FOOD), they will have new friendlier staff. If this is the case, and the food is consistent, I'll definitely change my rating to 5 STARS!",2,1,u88QmZjHoKNUa-h1h7p30g,12/9/2008,4,1,70,Restaurant

FTW!!!To be Continued...Thank goodness, we came here sober because who knows what would have happened if we ""attempted"" to come to PKL DRUNK in a cab especially with a restaurant name like ""Pho Kim Long"". :XOn Saturday, December 11th, my friend and I came to PKL at 2:45 PM (OPEN 24 HOURS) to nurse our massive hangovers and our growling stomachs. PKL was half filled and we were seated immediately. PKL is only a 5 min drive from the Strip which is about a $8 cab ride. CC's are accepted.F O O D:The menu is quite expensive so you can satisfy your Vietnamese craving for pho, bun, com or your Chinese craving for chow fun, ma po tofu, or various dishes with XO sauce for example. *CHA GIO (Vietnamese Egg Rolls - $6): Meh! I like my cha gio wrapped in rice paper wraps because it creates a crispier and flakier shell. The ones at PKL is wrapped in the standard egg roll wrapper made with flour and water which seems to doesn't maintain its crispness long. The cha gio arrived room temperature and some parts of the wrapper was soggy. The filling pork filling was a bland and the nuoc mam cham (fish sauce) was watered down as it was missing the pungency from the fish sauce and the spiciness from the chilies. *COMBO PHO ($7.95): The PERFECT hangover cure! The pho was flavorful and comforting, but coming from SF it's not the best I've had. Nevertheless, it IS best and  most ""authentic"" pho you will get near the Strip. The rice noodles were tender and al-dente and swimming in a pool of rich and savory beefy broth that wasn't laden with MSG. The rare beef slices and beef brisket were soft and tender, while the beef balls had a nice chewy spring to it. The bean sprouts, basil, jalapexc3xb1o and lime were fresh and were the perfect compliment to pho adding a nice crunch and freshness. My only gripe is there were no tendons or tripe in the combo nor was there any pho options with them. *FRESH YOUNG COCONUT ($3.50): The SECRET Hangover Cure!!! Coconut water contains all five of the essential electrolytes: calcium, potassium, phosphorous, magnesium and sodium needed for effective rehydration and has 15 times the amount of potassium as most sports drinks. So this is a MUST order along with your pho if you want to effectively nurse your hangover.Coconut water taste a little but like metallic water with a very hint sweetness so you can add sugar to it but you should really drink it a la natural. Make sure to eat the creamy flesh of the coconut because it improves insulin secretion and utilization of blood glucose.S E R V I C E:The staff is incredibly nice, attentive and fast which is rarity for Asian Restaurant. Our food came out within 5 minutes which is typical of most pho Restaurant and the manager (?) checked on us numerous times to make sure everything was ok. A M B I A N C E / D xc3x89 C O R:Dark rich woods, granite tables, various Vietnamese and Chinese shrines, and elaborate fish tanks with exotic fishes create a very nice and upscale environment. There are over 25 tables that are well-spaced out, so you don't have to worry about rubbing elbows with your neighbor. With the festivities of drunken debauchery that occurred this weekend and the aforementioned scenario in my head, why do I feel like it WILL happen on my next trip to Vegas? *covers eyes*",4,1,oQYtkgtiKYLXcE33leQCbg,12/13/2010,4,4,67,Restaurant

Yeah, like those fries would have gotten in my mouth without my full consent. I just happened upon this sparsely decorated eatery on the Yelp app and noticed a lot of approving reviews from what looked like the skinnier Yelpers in the Valley. I don't know Phoenix at all but found myself in what they call the North-Central area of town and there it was in a quiet strip mall.Steamed chicken aficionado that I am, the funny thing was that I had been wanting Hainan chicken which would have put my vegetarian aspirations on the back burner. I have a thing for steamed poultry I can't quite explain except I must be part Singaporean or channeling someone's grandmother up the Yangtze River. As fate would have it, this place was serving as its daily special the $9.95 Mock Hainan Chicken Rice. Such joyous rapture I felt for the prospect of such a culinary creation that I didn't hesitate to order it. It was surprisingly satisfying with the faux-poultry pinch-hitting quite nicely with the cucumber slices, dipping sauces, and infused rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcE75g).I also tried the delicious $5.95 Lettuce Wraps, which mixed together sauteed and finely chopped vegan 'meat', mushrooms, water chestnuts, shredded carrot, cilantro leaves, and fried rice noodles into an appetizing filling for the generously sized iceberg lettuce leaves (photo: http://bit.ly/2vcUwXJ). In this case, it was truly indistinguishable from its carnivorous counterpart. Other dishes looked quite tempting as they passed by my table like the Hawaiian Fried Rice and the Rainbow Salad. Given what a modest operation it appears to be, I have to say this was a great veggie find in Phoenix and well worth finding on your GPS.FOOD - 5 stars...great execution of vegan dishes you would not suspect would be so tastyAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...clean and modest-looking in its decorSERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly and helpful in explaining the genesis of their dishesTOTAL - 5 stars...nice to find a healthy dining experience as good as this that won't empty your wallet",17,9,Qxu9tD0zZmCuWTfk4SKvkA,7/18/2017,5,10,46,Restaurant

Little did I know this was the original one founded by alternative medicine guru Andrew Weil who based the menu on an ""anti-inflammatory food pyramid'. I don't know what the hell that means but that high-falutin' approach translates into a heavily vegetarian/vegan menu which was fine by me. I played it safe the first time by ordering Heirloom Tomatoes & Watermelon and Spaghetti Squash Casserole (no cheese please) and was quite satisfied (review: http://bit.ly/2zOmRJs).This time I felt a bit more audacious and first ordered the $9 Edamame Dumplings, which were surprisingly savory since they contained just dashi, white truffle oil, and Asian herbs to go along with the smashed soybeans. The meltably tasty wrappers helped add to the satisfaction of the rather soupy dish (photo: http://bit.ly/2yQGY9H). To complete my dinner, I went with the 410 Shiitake Lettuce Cups. The filling was, well, filling as it combined tofu, jicama, sambal, Thai basil, and cashew into a substantial mound of flavor easily scoopable (photo: http://bit.ly/2hiRds1). I just thought it rather odd that they presented long Romaine lettuce leaves as the wrappers as they aren't naturally grabble and cuppable like good ol' deconstructed iceberg wedges (photo: http://bit.ly/2AzWKmt).It was still tasty, but I misjudged the ratio of filling to lettuce leaf and had too much filling left. Not a bad problem because it was good all by itself, almost like a moo shu pork without the pork. Frankly all the dishes sound good here. Healthy too with a bit of an Asian accent on a lot of them like Teriyaki Quinoa and Spicy Panang Curry. The salads looked appetizing as they passed by, especially the $14 one that featured seasonal ingredients like asparagus and broccolini. The place was pretty packed for a weeknight with fit and aspiring-to-be-fit Phoenicians. No matter what end of the food pyramid I was eating, I just like what Dr. Weil has attempted to do here since the menu combines healthy and tasty in a refreshing way.FOOD - 4 stars...tasty and healthy on the same plate is always a good thingAMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious if a bit loud, even the counter allows for elbow roomSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty attentive considering the flow of diners coming in and outTOTAL - 4 stars...truly true food indeed",14,13,Xmi2MeaJhZm8noedWisfdQ,11/11/2017,4,10,37,Restaurant

Last time, we were stuck on the Strip with either extravagantly expensive Restaurant trademarked by brand name chefs or the $6.99 Prime Rib special. Nothing in between...nothing. Driving eight miles west of the Strip on Sahara Drive, you can find a stylish, low-key bistro in the middle of a strip mall. Yes, a strip mall. It's called Rosemary's, and there wasn't a sign of an obnoxious out-of-town gambler in the entire place. So here's the deal - $55 for a three-course prix fixe dinner, and you don't have to get two desserts. Instead, we went with three appetizers, two entrees and shared one dessert. Bonus points to Rosemary's for allowing such flexibility for the more peckish diners. It ended up being a whole lotta food, and most of it really good. We automatically got two big rolls on our bread plates, a Glazed White Chocolate Pecan and a Potato (see photo). Freshly baked and very tasty. We tried to save one for the dinner itself, but it was hard. Then we were given an amuse-bouche, a little square of Vegetable Bread Pudding with Shaved Chives that was a homey, heavenly pop in the mouth. The appetizers turned out to be a bit more hit-and-miss. The Twice Baked Parmesan Souffle with Garlic Cream Sauce and Saute of Wild Mushrooms (see photo) was impeccably presented but could have used more kick and texture to offset the excessive creaminess. The prawns in Hugo's Texas BBQ Shrimp were really succulent covered with the thick barbecue sauce, an unusual mix that mostly worked, but the Maytag Blue Cheese Slaw was just a little too mayo-like to fully enjoy (see photo). I think a vinaigrette would have worked better. The winners among the appetizers had to be the Panko Crusted Crab Boulettes with Emulsified Ravigote Sauce and Grandma's Sweet & Sour Cucumbers (see photo) where the crunchiness of the boulette's outer crust went very well with the relish-like sauce. There was nothing wrong with the Arugula, Endive & Radicchio Salad (see photo) except for the fact that it was completely overshadowed by the showy appetizers. Our luck significantly improved with the two entrees - the Creole Grilled Prime Ribeye with Anson Mills Carolina Quick Grits, Crystal Red Onion Crust and Rosemary's Own Steak Sauce, and the Grilled Veal Tenderloin with Saute of Asparagus, Prosciutto & Maitake Mushrooms and Roasted Garlic Reduction Sauce (see photos). Both were excellent - especially the way the meat was prepared, very tender and flavorful. Jamie and I were pretty full by this time (...we already had a to-go box ready for the leftover meat), but we couldn't leave without trying their Pecan Tart with Brown Sugar Ice Cream. If that wasn't enough, they left us a little plate of little cookies with the check (see photos). As good and abundant as the food was, it was really the attentive service that was most memorable about the meal. There seemed to be a trio of guys who were making sure we were served at exactly the right time and refilling our water glasses before they were empty. I kept imagining how much this experience would have cost if the place was in the Bellagio or the Wynn. So is it the Strip or a strip mall for you? Let your palate and pocketbook decide.

Arizona"" where three really polite women were describing their favorite local restaurant to the semi-interested host. The funny thing is that I was on an episode of ""Check, Please! Bay Area"" several years ago where I was one of three heavily opinionated people defending our restaurant choices as the host was pounding Chardonnay. What drew me here was that it was a well-regarded vegetarian place with an Asian accent much like the excellent Veggie Village (review: http://bit.ly/2uJzEZT). Will lightning strike twice?Phoenix always surprises me with its geographic size as it took me almost an hour to get here from Peoria where I was staying. The restaurant turned out to be in the middle of a shopping center parking lot which I have noticed is a common piece of real estate for a lot of eateries here. I must have been early because I was their first customer of the evening, and it looked like the manager was still working on the books at one of the tables. As I indulgently sidled into a booth that could easily fit four, it didn't take me long for me to figure out what to order because it all sounded organic and healthy to me. I first tried the $5.95 Fresh Cucumber Rolls which I first saw on the show.They rolled up fried tofu, marinated julienne white radish, carrot, and fresh mint, and vermicelli noodles, all rolled up in a thin slice of cucumber and served with a thick and delectable peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2jcfEbp). I frankly couldn't get enough of those. The same price Autumn and Summer Rolls appeared just as appetizing.

My company at the time used to let me stay here in one of the charming adobe casitas with the romantic fireplace. Now granted I was alone and without, ahem, equipment, but still it was a lovely spot. Now nearly twenty years later, I was given the task of finding a dining spot for a couple of colleagues and myself on a Monday evening. Now as you know, most fine Restaurant are closed on Mondays, so for some reason, I flashed back on the Hermosa and then I recalled a restaurant scene with Whitney Houston in ""Waiting to Exhale"".Shoop, shoop...anyway, that's how I found Lon's...seriously. As we were awaiting our third colleague, we strolled around the adobe-laden grounds which still had that southwestern allure I recall. As we entered the small bar and then the dining room, we noticed the decor was upscale cowboy ranch which I couldn't make up my mind was retro-chic or just faded old-school (photo: http://bit.ly/2f4fwXI). No matter as It turned out to be Arizona Restaurant Week, so we each took advantage of the three-course dinner available for $44 (photo: http://bit.ly/2eZzFzE).It started with a cutting board full of bread of which I took extreme liberties with the tasty mini-cornbread muffins (photo: http://bit.ly/2eQv4ig). My first course was the Crab-Stuffed Squash Blossoms in which the crab was mixed liberally with an aji Amarillo aioli. It was accompanied by bits of avocado, grape tomato halves and spicy sprouts (photo: http://bit.ly/2frXa7j). Good though rather tiny in portion for even an appetizer. My entree was the hefty Dry-Aged Heritage Pork Chop served with a hash made of yams, corn, hatch chiles and a swoosh of mole (photo: http://bit.ly/2dRVfse).While the pork was tender and succulent, the hash was somewhat disappointing since it tasted rather dry considering the interesting mix of flavors. We did on a satisfying sweet note sharing a trio of desserts - the Chocolate Caramel Tart with Salted Caramel Gelato (photo: http://bit.ly/2f1fEIw), Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Mango Curd and Coconut Sorbet (photo: http://bit.ly/2dZiRGj); and Lon's Signature Cowboy Candy Bar with chili-spiced ganache and hazelnuts (photo: http://bit.ly/2emUuTW).

Yes, I know you're gobsmacked, but it's true and Naked City Pizza is the proof. I usually don't pay that much attention to the Triple-D man, Guy Fieri, the man who single-handedly destroyed the Food Network, but occasionally some places he recommends are actually good. One was Broken Record back in San Francisco, but this may be his best find yet. This isn't the one he went to either as another Naked City Pizza, presumably the original location, is on the other side of the Strip in the back of a dive bar on Arville. Now that sounds like Triple D. Off the hook, dude.This one is in a makeshift office building on the way to the airport which is exactly why Jamie W. and I ended up here. It wasn't crowded at about 5PM, just one ravenous family next to the window. The paper menu was a bit tattered, but we thought everything they offered appeared quite tempting. We decided the share the $7.50 Naked Salad, a bargain that combined iceberg lettuce, spinach, roasted sweet peppers, white onion, marinated tomato, and shredded mozzarella, all of it tossed in a housemade vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/1RCNyjX). It was that tangy dressing along with the fresh ingredients that made this salad really hit the spot.Because of the subheader description, ""Featured on Food Network's DDD"",  the Guinea Pie was our pizza of choice. It's made the old-fashioned Sicilian way in a rectangular, cookie-sheet shape with a soft, aerated dough that was quite amazing. The main topping was what they referred to as Grandma's Meatballs, which looked to be sliced and mixed with mint, accompanied by baby spinach leaves, heaping spoonfuls of ricotta, mozzarella and white garlic sauce. We decided to go for the $14.95 quarter sheet, which was plenty since it consisted of six hefty pieces (photo: http://bit.ly/1QoTOco). I think that dough could have handled any topping, but the white-on-white, Buffalo-style combination worked really well.

It's what's for dinner. That was the slogan for the Beef Advisory Council way back when I was an ad agency media planner. I saw Cybill Shepherd on a commercial shoot, and she took one look at the steak on the counter, admitted she was a vegetarian, and marched to her dressing room. Gee, that has nothing to do with Fleming's, but it's funny what sticks with you all these years later when I was at a company outing in Phoenix. This was the place our CIO chose for our group dinner, a generous gesture as the dinner reflected the dishes the restaurant chain are most renowned.After taking advantage of platters of appetizers including the Sweet Chile Calamari and Bacon-Wrapped Scallops (photo: http://bit.ly/2kOAy0w), we were all seated in the private dining room. We each got samplings of two salads - the Modern Caesar with fried capers and proscuitto chips accompanied by Parmesan toast (photo: http://bit.ly/2kZSVSp), as well as the New Wedge with slab-cut bacon, blistered cherry tomatoes, and crumbled gorgonzola cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/2ksZyJz). Both were quite satisfying with the wedge a nice translation of the steakhouse staple. This was followed by a quartet of scrumptious sides.Fleming's Potatoes is a decadent house specialty - scalloped, molded like a brick, and heavy with cream and cheddar cheese with a bit of jalapexc3xb1o (photo: http://bit.ly/2lqva6X), and the Truffle-Parsley Mashed Potatoes, saturated in cream and butter, made it a double header of artery-clogging starchy goodness. The Grilled High Country Asparagus and Sautxc3xa9ed Mushrooms made a valiant attempt to offset the potatoes but to little avail (photo: http://bit.ly/2ksVLvW). The main attraction was, of course, the steak, and the 12-ounce Main Filet Mignon was tender, iron-crusted and drizzled with melted butter (photo: http://bit.ly/2kayDkJ). Quite a treat.As if we were not wallowing in enough self-indulgence, there was a triple helping of dessert. The Walnut Turtle Pie was gooey good with housemade caramel, walnuts, and chocolate (photo: http://bit.ly/2kVaBPi), and the New York Cheesecake was classically conventional with its graham cracker crust and blueberry sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2kao6pV). My favorite was the Crxc3xa8me Brxc3xbblxc3xa9e, a large serving of Tahitian vanilla bean custard served with fresh berries (photo: http://bit.ly/2kaByda).

Somehow I had it in my head that the Wild Wild West was the hidden gem of Vegas buffets. Well, when Jamie W. and I drove there, we discovered that it was a tired motel filled with frog-voiced smokers next to a Denny's. Surely my mind was playing tricks on me. As I realized much later, it was Sam's Town I was looking for, but regardless, we were jonesing for breakfast. Thanks to the trusty Yelp app on my iPhone, we zeroed in on WaffleS Cafe. Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall just like almost every non-Strip eatery in town. It really looks like a smoothie shop since I couldn't tell if they even had a kitchen. The overhead menu would have you believe it's a virtual waffle-palooza in there. Perhaps but I didn't hear the sound of a griddle or the plop of the batter, which made me think the waffles are made elsewhere and heated up in the back. It was just too quiet in there. Anyhow, both of us went for the $5.49 Breakfast Special - which consisted of a large, round waffle; a couple of eggs; bacon or sausage; and a cup of coffee. I ordered the pumpkin waffle and had blueberries and whipped cream placed on top. It was good, and the meaty sausage and scrambled eggs helped a lot. Jamie showed greater forbearance and had his pumpkin waffle plain with a pat of butter, but he weakened and went for the bacon. All in all, it didn't feel substantive enough to be the breakfast we desired, but it did tie us over until the dogs we had at Pink's for lunch. Not because of the server, who was quite nice and cheery, but I doubt if I'll be back simply because it is slipping from my memory as I write this.

Sharing the same, luxurious theme as its neighbor, it may share a bridge and various Restaurant and such, but rest assured the Encore is very much its own property.A recipient of the latest AAA 5 Diamond, it joins a very small handful of hotel establishments throughout Vegas. This basically means Encore has distinction of calling itself one of the most sophisticated, scintillating hotel properties in the world. An establishment that skimps on nothing less than decadent and showcases nothing but the finest. From its sleek exterior to its posh interior, there is no doubt this is a winner for Steve Wynn.With 63 floors, the Encore is actually marginally taller than the Wynn and features a ton of space for casino, retail, hotel, and convention purposes. Like many of the casino resorts along the strip, there is almost plenty of options in every direction though at the Encore, there is less of a need to exit in the name of seeing, eating, and doing. They really do have it all.Room accommodations are impressive from lowest standard two bed room to the ultra high end, massive suites for players. Wynn has invested so much to ensure the comfort levels in every room meet the high standards that most people have for this place. Personally, it comes down to the bed for me. I've never slept better.The casino side isn't nearly as impressive as the Wynn. There seem to be some elements of Wynn Macau here, but on a whole the ambiance of gaming isn't for me anyways, a large selling point. Boutique casinos have a way of keeping the experience intimate for particular gamblers, but the feeling here is no different than like its Palazzo rival.On the nightlife front, is there a better and more celebrated club than XS? For years, my favorite spot was La Bete, which later turned into Tryst (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tryst-nightclub-las-vegas-2) but now XS takes the cake. XS alone probably brings in more visitors than any club in Vegas and amongst the younger nightlife inspired crowd, is potentially the number one reason folks end up paying Encore a visit.Folks looking for a different eating experience will certainly find it at Sinatra (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sinatra-las-vegas) and the same goes for the clubby yet foodie ambiance of Andrea's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas). Wazuzu (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wazuzu-las-vegas) is kind of like an overpriced Asian fusion diner, which is totally skippable in the Encore experience. I personally enjoy every meal at Society Cafe Encore (http://www.yelp.com/biz/society-cafe-encore-las-vegas-5) but that's just me. The line up of eateries may not be impressive compared to its casino counterparts, but at least the places featured are quality.Lastly, I think Encore would be the ultimate property if famous Vegas performer Danny Gans were still alive today. When he was set to perform at Encore as his new home 4 years ago, he was also featured on what was at the time the largest freestanding marquee in the world. Garth Brooks is certainly no slouch, but Gans and his already bustling LV fame would've been the city's top featured act.While I don't think Encore lives up to the same standard as its bigger sister, it is still among the best on the strip for everything it offers. There is no losing scenario when it comes to staying here - it is still worth it for its location, name, and all that it has to offer.",10,7,lePNDagp9AyIwEGM7iUgWQ,10/18/2013,4,1,45,Shopping

Even 4 years after its inception, it can still be debated on whether the turmoil that lead to erecting this massive collection of properties was worth it.There were a number of issues, which could directly be attributed to timing, bad management, and financial handling that kept delayed construction and its eventual opening in 2009. For instance, 6 people died in the construction of the site, prompting a strike from the workers who were concerned for their safety after working on the project for what was then a non-stop 24 hour schedule. Then there was the 2008 world recession, which left a virtual hole in the Strip, leading to a major decline in tourism and money for the city. Delays ensued when the Dubai folks decided to sue their joint venture partners MGM for a breach of contract. Let's not forget that after it opened, it failed to land much fanfare for almost two years the rash (pun intended) of sunburning incidents due to the construction of the Vdara reflecting beams from the sun? After initial estimates of 4 billion to complete the project, the subsequent total cost was more than double, at a cool 9 billion dollars.There is still The Harmon, a tower that was meant to be a boutique non-gaming resort that has never opened to the public. Halted after realizing there were major construction defects during the building process, it has been OK'd for demolition which is likely to happen later in the year or in 2014.Whether it was worth 9 billion or not, the general makeup of CityCenter is aesthetically pleasing. The Veer Towers (http://www.yelp.com/biz/veer-towers-las-vegas) are a nice high rise living option on the Strip to those who can afford it. In all of its sunburning glory, the Vdara (http://www.yelp.com/biz/vdara-las-vegas-2) is a pretty non-gaming hotel and the Mandarin Oriental (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mandarin-oriental-las-vegas-las-vegas) is one of the nicest resorts in the United States, let alone Las Vegas. There are eyeballs widening from all corners for Crystals (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crystals-at-citycenter-las-vegas), a mall where no limit credit cards can be happily utilized. The most well known property through the thick of it all is the ARIA (http://www.yelp.com/biz/aria-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas), if not one of the better casino hotels on the south Strip, if not among the most scintillating.The CityCenter, in spite of its initial problems, provides all visitors to the Strip luxurious options to spend their time in the City of Sin. It brings out a new dimension architecturally, a flashy range of eateries, venues, and entertainment, and will hopefully live up to all the hype it has built up for itself for the better part of the last decade.",8,6,54Ffdt_ucV3uCZWuWjDaXQ,10/26/2013,3,3,-5,Shopping

Thank you Yelp for sending me their way!Belly Bliss is a combination of things - a boutique store for mamas-to-be (and future dads), a spa, and offers classes and groups that are related to pregnancy and babies.Recently, I went specifically to experience their spa services.  Taking advantage of their seasonal specials, I got the Joyful Package for $170.  It consisted of a 60 minute ""Girls Getaway"" massage and a 90 minute signature ""Body in Balance"" facial treatment.  Joann M. was my massage therapist and Margo S. was my aesthetician.  Because this place specializes in working with pregnant woman, they make every attempt to make sure that you are comfortable during all your treatments.  Tables easily adjust for the head and body and plenty of pillows and supports are available for your comfort.  Both were professional and friendly and you get the feeling they both really enjoy working with all their pregnant clients. (Margo told me to come back again and bring the baby!)  Sure, there are plenty of spas in town that offer prenatal massage, but you end up paying an upcharge to use their facilities.  When in actuality, most pregnant women are discouraged from using the jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc.  So you end up feeling a bit short changed when all you wanted was some personal body work done.  Belly Bliss gives you just that without all the frills.  They only have a few treatments rooms available, so it shouldn't be crowded when you go.Once your treatment is done, you can help yourself to their little snack bar where you can fill a take out box full of pretzels, goldfish crackers, lollipops, and raisins.  Plenty of spa water and apples are available too.Getting treatments done on Tuesdays also gives you 10% off your spa services!  Sweet!  Apparently, free eyebrow waxes and foot massages are available on Tuesdays as well.  Call ahead to confirm and make reservations! You can't help but take a look through their store on your way out.  So many cool and useful items are available for you to check out and purchase.  It can be a bit dangerous actually!Belly Bliss is located on the 2nd floor of the Desert Perinatal Associates office, so doctors are only a few steps away if you're really concerned about anything.Classes include Breastfeeding, Yoga (Pre and Postnatal), Newborn Care and Immunization, Baby Massage, How to Select a Childcare Facility, and Childbirth Education.  Medela breast pumps are available for rental too! They also have party rental space if you want to plan a baby shower or private party at their facility.Gift certificates are available and any pregnant girl would be happy to receive a service from Belly Bliss!  Husbands, boyfriends, fathers, partners, friends - check this place out and give a great gift for a future mama!

This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.Walking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)Walking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)  I will definitely be going back there again though because we bought the gift cards!",20,14,7eN2z5q4Hy-3A0J-4Ld87g,3/28/2013,5,9,37,Shopping

There were a lot of staff on hand though to help with this situation. Three varieties of flatbread pizza ($7) were available made to order along with a cheese and fruit plate ($6). We chose the latter to share.One of the first things I noticed was the stage set up where the instructor would be teaching from and the disco balls. There was good lighting overall. When class finally got under way at 7 pm, loud music was filling up the room. We were given the intros of Ebony, the instructor, and Jef and Caroline, her two assistants. Everyone also had headset microphones on, so that made the event quite engaging. The assistants were on hand to help out with any questions and to keep the party going. This painting experience was different because it definitely was more of a party. The music was upbeat and relational to whatever Ebony was talking about. It was particularly helpful that she had scratch paper taped to the wall so she could show us how to paint something. The tables are lined with butcher paper, so you're encouraged to use the paper to mix colors. This particular painting seemed a bit more challenging than another I painted elsewhere and we learned more technique from this particular class. There were mini breaks and plenty of opportunities to drink up. There was even a longer break available so you could take advantage of their free photo booth ($1 to print or free to Facebook/Twitter) and costumes. One break even had everyone up and doing the Cupid Shuffle!They normally charge $45/per person for the teaching class, but I heard there might be a $5 locals discount. Double check that. I also noticed their calendar says the class is from 7 to 9, with registration opening at 6:30. We actually finished closer to 10 too. They have daytime open painting sessions for $25 per person as well. Overall, this was a fun experience and a great way to paint with a large group. However, it could be a bit distracting for some with the music and jokes, so it depends on what kind of painting experience you are looking for.  4.5 stars",8,5,YhOzQ7zUguVx7HlPSA36Sg,9/26/2013,5,2,26,Shopping

On my first visit there, it's easy to get swept away by all the fancy crib set ups and adorable baby things.  As Jennifer L. pointed out, this is a boutique store and along with that comes the boutique prices.  But the cool thing about boutiques is that you find things that you don't normally see at the chain stores.On this occasion, we were in search of baby carriers and knew they would be in the back per Ernesto R.'s review.  However, we were a bit distracted by the latest and greatest of strollers - the Orbit.  This is the new Bugaboo of strollers and comes with a hefty price tag in the range of $1000.  The employees were more than happy to show us how it works and we were impressed, although not quite sold.  We eventually made our way to the back where we found a variety of carriers, especially the ErgoBaby.  We wanted to try it on for size and see how the Baby liked it.  The employee was really helpful with assisting us and bringing out an Infant Carrier so we could try it out.  They weren't overly pushy with assistance and left us alone to wander around as well.Specialty high chairs - specifically the Swan and Stokke are also available here and it gave me a chance to look it over and ponder if this was the kind of thing we wanted in our kitchen.Our second visit came as a result of Groupon!  Dagermans was featured and we definitely took advantage of this coupon.  There was one particular bodysuit we had our eye on during that first visit and purchased it this time around.  We also discovered the Mustela line of baby products, and definitely appreciated their insight on these items and the samples provided too.There were employees offering their assistance left and right, which I did appreciate.  This is a rather large store though, so you need to take your time to absorb everything they sell.  This time around I got to really look at a few of the more unique items while the Husband focused on the Baby's convertible car seat.Apparently, you can also create a Baby Registry with them!  Fancy that!We'll be going back for sure, especially with those groupons on hand!  Definitely worth a visit to see what else there is beyond your typical chain baby store.",4,3,XESk5wfRVAxnoeQshxiMHA,6/2/2011,4,3,25,Shopping

We always welcome a little healthy competition, even if Vegas does seem a bit over saturated with foot massage places.  We aren't always so anxious to make the drive to Spring Mountain to get some foot work done.The Husband noticed the sign driving on S. Rainbow and with only two yelp reviews, we were a bit hesitant.  We called ahead to find out the prices and to see if there was any availability.  They normally charge $38/hr, but with the Yelp discount - it's $34.  (They are currently offering a Yelp Deal too - $15 for $20 towards service, which I doubt you can combine.)We didn't make an appointment but were the only ones there last night.  Angel warmly greeted us and had us take a seat amongst the handful of chairs in the main room.  As she went to get us our tea, she hastily made a few calls getting her employees in as they had gone on an errand.  She told us about her business, gave us some information on Pure Foot & Spa and reflexology, and asked us what we thought of the interior decorating.  She had our feet soaking in the hot water while we waited, so we didn't mind.  It wasn't too long when one of the ladies returned.  She immediately got started on the Husband, so Angel started working on me while I waited for my guy to return.  As her delicate hands started working on my face, I was almost hoping my guy didn't return.  (There are some people that have gentle hands, and she's one of them.)  After a few minutes, my guy did arrive and he got started on me.Everything was pretty straightforward from them on - they work on your head, neck, and shoulders before heading to your feet and calves.  And after wiping down your feet, they flip you over so you get some back work.  One thing I really appreciate here is that they actually spend a good amount of time on your feet and calves.  Sometimes other places focus more on shoulders, but my feet and calves were what needed the attention and they got it.  Usually, I can tell the Husband is having a good experience when I hear him snoring.  This time, I didn't hear him snore at all, so I was concerned.  I was pleasantly surprised when he asked the name of his lady though because he obviously wanted to remember who she was.  Overall, we were both quite happy with our experience at Pure Foot and definitely glad to have them in the neighborhood.  We'll definitely be going back again!He had EVA and I had IVAN.* They charge $1 to use your credit card.  I recommend calling to make an appointment to be sure.

We made an afternoon out of visiting the Neon Museum and the Mob Museum. Both are located in the same general area, outside Freemont. You can get a slight discount by purchasing tickets online to both museums. We encountered no problems at all with the online ticket purchases.  It is possible to get here without a car or taxi. We took a bus from the Strip and walked a while. This may not be advisable if it's super hot, but we did not find the walk bad at all. The walk is through  a mix of businesses and some housing and is definitely not upscale, but I did not feel unsafe, especially in broad daylight. After reading the many Yelp reviews that advised visiting during the day, we followed the Yelpers' recommendations and came in the afternoon. It is hot, but they provide black umbrellas at no additional charge to shield you from the sun. The only way to see the signs is by guided tour. You cannot just wander around. They say that it is too dangerous, since many of the signs contain old, toxic chemicals and apparently they're worried about people walking around the signs unsupervised. Our tour guide was so enthusiastic and informative. I had not been that interested in Vegas history before coming here, but I left our tour wanting to learn so much more. I recommend brushing up on your panoramic photo skills before coming here. Since you have to stand so close to the signs during the guided tour, you can't get a photo of many of the larger signs without using a panoramic setting. It also may be difficult to get pictures of all the signs you want since you have to keep moving with the tour. They do give you some time at the end to take pictures with the larger signs near the entrance, but you can't go back and take pictures of the smaller signs. They also have a really great gift shop with lots of cool magnets, stationary, tees and postcards. I would like to see postcards of more of the signs, though.Overall, I was super happy with this experience and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas. I'd love to come back for the night tour, especially if they are able to renovate more of the signs.",4,1,33dIZ65rbNukvziMkrqK7g,6/17/2016,5,1,13,Shopping

In the past six plus years since my initial review, I've been extremely loyal to The Root.  I've lost track of the number of times I've visited, and I've seen a handful of stylists but I cannot think of one time that I left the salon not feeling beautiful.  Five star experiences consistently... you don't find that very often!Since my last review, the salon also moved locations, just a tad bit south of their original location.  The new space is awesome.  It has a great, friendly vibe and it's super high tech.  Everyone that works there is friendly and easy to talk to... they really do live by the values on their website: relationships, creativity, fun, learning, humor, hard work, happiness and respect.I typically go in for a cut and standard color (ever since the greys started coming in), but I once got a pink streak in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, and I've gotten a brow wax and a make-up application at The Root as well.  They have plenty of services to offer... my husband has been in for both hair cuts and beard trims too!As mentioned above, I've been loyal to TRS, but I've seen a handful of stylists.  I trust anyone that Laurxc3xa9n hires, and I usually just book ahead with whom ever can accommodate my often busy schedule.  In addition to Laurxc3xa9n herself, I've seen Jillian and Dana, Desiree and Forest, and have been pleased every time.  Huge shout-out to Forest whom I saw most recently for the perfect color job and double french braid I requested at the last minute instead of a blow-out.  She is seriously a braiding expert.  It was perfect!I left the salon and headed to my kids' T-Ball game where I got a ton of compliments on my braids.  It then lasted through dinner, a night of sleep, and a hot yoga class the next day!  Thank you again, Forest!

Most department stores have a very limited stock and Target doesn't even sell them until January.  #2 - bathing suit shopping is never fun especially during holiday season when workouts get cut short and holiday parties with endless amounts of food and drinks replace them.So, I was on a mission to find a new bathing suit for an upcoming vacation and I was not looking forward to it.  A friend of mine suggested 'Exquisite Swimwear' so I decided to check it out.  I'd seen the cute bathing suits in the window before but this was my first time going in.I received a warm welcome when I entered the store and later learned that the owner (Pauline) was who it came from.  I looked around on my own first and admired all the cute suits, accessories, cover ups, and more... then I felt a bit overwhelmed so I asked for her help.  When I told Pauline what styles and colors I prefer, she pulled a bunch of suits for me to try on... I narrowed it down to two suits and she was very honest in telling me which one she liked better.  (I hate it when you are shopping and the person helping you is not honest!)Needless to say, I walked out with a new suit, so it was a productive trip... I was impressed with the store, the selection, and even the fact that in the dressing rooms, they offer disposable panties to try on suits with... of course the suits have hygienic liners as well, but this was an added bonus.  I was tempted by the clothing, headbands, sandals, and more, but I was on a mission for a bathing suit, so that's what I got!I totally recommend Exquisite Swimwear to anyone looking for a new bathing suit.  It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for... designer, good quality swimwear, great selection, and service too.  As I said before, bathing suit shopping is not fun for most of us, but Pauline made it a very pleasant experience for me.  Now onto my next mission, get some suntan on this pale skin of mine :)",3,3,fyAXFfM4lANDj-FeRQTUpQ,12/20/2007,4,1,47,Shopping

Marti was extremely accommodating and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the pricing for our group was reasonable compared to some of the other cooking schools that I was looking into.

I hunted through and found a few things but didn't have the patience to try stuff on, so I picked out five cute bottoms that were on the 5 for $25 table, a cute night shirt and boy short bottoms, and a couple of other things.  I waited in line and the lady who rang me up tried to sell me on their Angel card.  No thanks I said.  ""Are you sure?"" She asked and proceeded to tell me all about the wonderful benefits of the Angel Card.  ""Not today, thanks"" was my reply.Then she told me one of the bottoms I chose was on sale and no longer part of the 5 for $25 deal.  So I went to choose another pair.  When she told me the same thing about another pair, I'd had enough.  I didn't need eight new pairs of underwear... at that point I was annoyed and chose only a few of the original ones I liked.  I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there.Sure, VS is an alright store, but they need to work on their customer service at this location.  They do sell cute stuff but I'm not so sure about the quality.  I'd much rather prefer shopping at a lingerie boutique but VS is more affordable than most cute higher quality boutiques so I'm sure I'll be back to spend the rest of my gift card money another time soon.  I'll hopefully pick a time to go next time that is not as crazy crowded and perhaps maybe even find a different location where the sales people are pleasant to deal with... I'm sure I could find a push-up bra, t-shirt bra, magic this, or special that... I know they sell something for women of all shapes and sizes.  :)Oh, and if you're wondering, I did wear my purchase on NYE and it worked like a charm - for that, I'm bumping up their two stars to three.

C&B puts these events on several Sundays a year... and they do them before hours, so they can attend to the needs of the couples that are there.  It got me in there... unfortunately, I can't say the same for my fiance, who just has no interest in registering.  Thank goodness my mother-in-law-to-be went with me instead.  We walked in and were given a lesson on the ""gun"" and off we went.  Along the way, we stopped plenty of the friendly salespeople with detailed questions about the merchandise.  They were also doing demonstrations and tasting of coffee, fondue, cutlery, etc... and serving mimosas; now that made registering much more fun!We still have to go to another store or two, I'm told, but we found plenty of great kitchenware and houseware at C&B to get us started.  And even if we don't end up with anything we registered for, we had fun in the process!Thanks C&B for having us today, and for the heart shaped serving piece gift as well.****There are still events like this on February 22 and March 1, so if you're needing to register, go check it out.

Based on this alone, I would give the hotel five stars.  BUTFor a room this pricey (over $250 a night on Expedia), I'd expect better sound proofing.  I could hear people's conversations while they were walking down the hallways and in adjacent rooms (even rooms above ours).  I didn't expect so much sound transfer.  Plus, you can hear XS going on all night through the window wall.  There was just a lot of noise.  The toilet in the bathroom sounded like it was exploding every time it was flushed, and you could similarly hear this through two bathroom doors into the living space.  We were given two card keys, and one didn't work.  Also, we had trouble operating the shades and drapes.  Sometimes they worked, and sometimes they didn't and needed some fiddling.  We were left a message saying there was a cake delivery for my birthday.  We made sure to turn off the ""privacy  button, and we waited for going on two hours and no one arrived.  The next day, we were told that our privacy light was on, which was bull, because we specifically made sure it was off.It's still a nice hotel.

We snuck peeks of the ""boneyard"" through a chain-link fence covered in black plastic sheets since we weren't aware that you had to buy tickets in advance, and we were leaving Vegas that evening. Well, it only took us seven years to return to this genuinely open-air museum, this time with tickets in hand and happy to see that the 1961 lobby of the La Concha Motel was restored to become the visitors' center as planned (photo: http://bit.ly/2nmLQNm). Souvenir photos while you wait for the tour are purely optional (photo: http://bit.ly/2nRkETv)It's all quite organized with hour-long tours leaving every half-hour led by enthusiastic docents who go into the history of Vegas and the particulars of the more iconic signs on display. Strict rules abound with no backpacks allowed. Selfie sticks are also verboten, a rule I fervently applaud. Get that away from me. Because of the blazing sun, we were provided umbrellas and complimentary water bottles to allow us to survive the walk. The aged signs are arranged mostly to follow the historical timeline of Las Vegas starting with the signs for the Lido (photo:  http://bit.ly/2mg1hqG) and Binion's Horseshoe (photo: http://bit.ly/2n2Hc5R) built in the early 1950's. Granted much of what you see still looks like Fred Sanford's junkyard.At the same time, familiar landmarks like the Golden Nugget (photo: http://bit.ly/2n9UU7M) and the Tropicana (photo: http://bit.ly/2nmPgQ8) pop up as well as unique pieces for wedding chapels, Elvis (photo: http://bit.ly/2nn49la), and a gigantic skeletal skull (photo: http://bit.ly/2n2rZSC). The renowned hotel names show up at the end of the trail with the Frontier, the Dessert Inn, and especially the massive Stardust signs featured (photo: http://bit.ly/2mI74BG). Another part of the museum is located on the street median in the Fremont East area where refurbished neon signs are on display and lit up at night (photo: http://bit.ly/2nR7O7G).

It must have worked because on my very next business trip to Phoenix, I decided to take a detour toward Scottsdale to find this place. It honestly looked like a sterile corporate business park upon approach, which should come as no surprise since it was founded by Robert J. Ulrich, the former CEO and Chairman of the Target Corporation. What was surprising was how cavernous this place is inside with over 6,600 musical instruments on display broken out geographically.My 4th grade music teacher, Miss Nelson, would have loved this place since she forced me to play ""Greensleeves"" on the autoharp in front of my class. Covering over 200,000 square feet, the museum starts with an impressive gallery of guitars in a semicircular room (photo: http://bit.ly/2zWa5bE) followed by a room of musical instruments which appear to be a sneak preview of what you're about to see on the second floor (photo: http://bit.ly/2AEkp4q). A long escalator ride upward takes you to the Geographic Galleries where you walk through five cavernous rooms representing the major regions of the world. In each room, there are unique instruments that represent each country in that region. Yes, every country has its own section.Through a wireless guidePORT you're given at the front desk, you basically walk up to any exhibit with a video running, and you can listen to that performance as you approach it because the headphones are activated automatically. Needless to say, you should take your time perusing these rooms because each exhibit provides a fascinating insight into that country's culture (photo: http://bit.ly/2icRWM7). Despite the exotic sights and sounds found in most of the rooms, the United States/Canada gallery is the largest with special sections devoted to the electric guitar, Steinway pianos, rap, country, Hawaiian music, and even a miniature symphony orchestra in a lucite display case (photo: http://bit.ly/2yBxL0T).Once done with the Geographic Galleries, you walk down a spiral staircase back to the first floor where you can enter the Artist Gallery. Here you find exhibits dedicated to musical icons ranging from Elvis (photo: http://bit.ly/2yBy9wn) to Carlos Santana (photo: http://bit.ly/2jm9R6y) to Taylor Swift. I wanted to visit the Experience Gallery, but it was closed when I visited and appeared to be focused more on kids anyway. That's my one minor criticism, the lack of opportunities for adults to interact with some of the more popular instruments like they allow in Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture (review: http://bit.ly/2lkGq5q) or LA's Grammy Museum (review: http://bit.ly/2mlxEVk).

My biggest issue was the three times we had set an appointment only to have them flat out no show.  We went with the 9am-noon blocks each time to prevent us sitting around waiting all day but that's exactly what happened.  One time they said they didn't have a record of us making an appointment and twice where they said there was an emergency and they couldn't get to us (they only told me this when I called around noon asking where they were).  I would havve gone with someone else if they had not already replaced the fan and the other instance where I had already given them a deposit for the light fixtures.  So triple check your appointments if you go through them!",19,4,76s8PJyTY4Wr21BWZZMPAw,11/26/2012,2,5,10,Home & Service

I ended up calling a bunch of plumbing companies to see who could come out the fastest and one was able to get there in 20 minutes.  One of the water pipes coming from upstairs was cracked (nice looking out, fucking home inspector) and the plumber recommended AFR to assess the damage.  I am sure he got a nice kickback out of it but I needed someone ASAP to get this on the right track and they were able to come in less than 30 minutes.  They ended up taking down half the ceiling and about 30% of the walls of the garage.  The guys then set up 3 industrial sized dehumidifiers downstairs and 3 upstairs which sat there for a week to ensure everything would be dry before repair could begin.

Unfortunately, when I went to do some research on local cooking classes, most of them were way out of our budget.  That is, until I spoke to Marti at Sweet Basil.  Marti was extremely accommodating and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the pricing for our group was reasonable compared to some of the other cooking schools that I was looking into.  There was a great selection of menus to choose from as well.  I went with the ""Easy Entertaining"" option, which included recipes for the following items:* Baked Brie with Shallots & Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce* Smoked Salmon Cakes with Lemon Dill Aioli* Grilled chicken Satay with Ginger Mustard Sauce* Bloody Mary Shrimp* Pork Pot Stickers with Garlic Soy* Pepper-Crusted Steak with Horseradish cream* Mini Caramel Pecan Pies with Bourbon whipped CreamWhen the group arrived, there were aprons for all, and Marti introduced herself and Chef Linda prior to us beginning.  Our group was ready to get our hands dirty right away, but we did have to be patient as Chef Linda walked us through each recipe... From there, we buddied up (except for Emi H who bravely took on the Chicken Satay on her own) and were on our own with the large kitchen and ingredients.  Tiffany and I did the Brie which was by far the easiest, but we had fun with it and it turned out incredibly (if I can say so myself)!All in all, this was a fabulous evening, and great for team building too... but if you do book Sweet Basil, a couple of things to keep in mind that may be helpful:*While SB does provide iced tea and water, they allow BYOB, so if your group is anything like mine, I do recommend taking advantage and bringing some wine!*You'll likely begin your class promptly at 6:30, but won't be digging into the food for quite some time, so you may want to grab a bite prior to arriving or ask about purchasing some snacks to nosh on while you eat.In addition to the above, note that SB is also a fabulous store for all kinds of cookware, kitchen accessories, and more...

Being a first timer, I also watched a 6 minute video on how to maximize my float time which offered some helpful suggestions (body position, breathing) while glazing over some new age, self improvement stuff.  John also informed me to hang in their relaxation room upon finishing since many feel disoriented and extremely euphoric afterwards.  Uhhh..what??

Needless to say we were nervous when the big day finally came for her to get the procedure done.  You hear that there's a high 90% success rate but a person only has one pair of eyes.  Dr. Siems and his staff made my wife as comfortable as possible (valium helped).  I was able to view the whole procedure on a television outside of the operating room and it definitely made me wince a little when they cut the lens and started shooting the lasers in her eyes. The whole procedure took less than 30 minutes.  She then took another valium and slept for about 18 hours.  She was able to see very clearly the next day and it just improved from there.  Post operation checkups are included in the price so the day after, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year were all taken care of.  Now that it has been well over a year, she says it's one of the best things she's ever done in life.  I've worn glasses more than half of my life and feel like the fat guy at Mr Olympia or the dude with no tattoos in a tattoo parlor when I go in there.  They always ask me when I am going to do it.  I am still on the fence about getting it done myself but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate to go with Siems.",28,12,PeYoFeu4UYMxX9pFqZAt2w,3/5/2013,5,9,17,Health & Medical

Thank you Yelp for sending me their way!Belly Bliss is a combination of things - a boutique store for mamas-to-be (and future dads), a spa, and offers classes and groups that are related to pregnancy and babies.Recently, I went specifically to experience their spa services.  Taking advantage of their seasonal specials, I got the Joyful Package for $170.  It consisted of a 60 minute ""Girls Getaway"" massage and a 90 minute signature ""Body in Balance"" facial treatment.  Joann M. was my massage therapist and Margo S. was my aesthetician.  Because this place specializes in working with pregnant woman, they make every attempt to make sure that you are comfortable during all your treatments.  Tables easily adjust for the head and body and plenty of pillows and supports are available for your comfort.  Both were professional and friendly and you get the feeling they both really enjoy working with all their pregnant clients. (Margo told me to come back again and bring the baby!)  Sure, there are plenty of spas in town that offer prenatal massage, but you end up paying an upcharge to use their facilities.  When in actuality, most pregnant women are discouraged from using the jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc.  So you end up feeling a bit short changed when all you wanted was some personal body work done.  Belly Bliss gives you just that without all the frills.  They only have a few treatments rooms available, so it shouldn't be crowded when you go.Once your treatment is done, you can help yourself to their little snack bar where you can fill a take out box full of pretzels, goldfish crackers, lollipops, and raisins.  Plenty of spa water and apples are available too.Getting treatments done on Tuesdays also gives you 10% off your spa services!  Sweet!  Apparently, free eyebrow waxes and foot massages are available on Tuesdays as well.  Call ahead to confirm and make reservations! You can't help but take a look through their store on your way out.  So many cool and useful items are available for you to check out and purchase.  It can be a bit dangerous actually!Belly Bliss is located on the 2nd floor of the Desert Perinatal Associates office, so doctors are only a few steps away if you're really concerned about anything.Classes include Breastfeeding, Yoga (Pre and Postnatal), Newborn Care and Immunization, Baby Massage, How to Select a Childcare Facility, and Childbirth Education.  Medela breast pumps are available for rental too! They also have party rental space if you want to plan a baby shower or private party at their facility.Gift certificates are available and any pregnant girl would be happy to receive a service from Belly Bliss!  Husbands, boyfriends, fathers, partners, friends - check this place out and give a great gift for a future mama!

(What's even sweeter, you can buy 5 gift cards and get 1 free here!! Score!)Bali Foot Spa is yet another place that has popped up in Vegas and smack dab in the oh so popular area of Spring Mountain.  This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.Walking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)Walking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)

Where does one begin with the plethora of foot massage places along Spring Mountain? I took a chance and called The Foot Spa. I inquired if they had 2 females available in five minutes and they said yes. After explaining our options between the Basic ($20/hr) or Deep Tissue ($30/hr), and Yelp 'specials', we settled on the Basic. (Basic is more footwork whereas Deep Tissue is more back work.)We were led into the main room that has about 7 massage beds. I went to the restroom first and noticed they were out of soap. I took the time to open the dispenser in hopes that they 'just' ran out. Nope. Nothing in there. I even checked under the sink and found 3 more empty soap bottles! I was desperate and added some water and shook it just to get something soapy to wash my hands with. I reported back to the Husband with my discovery and was surprised he didn't suggest leaving. Buckets of hot water arrived for our feet to soak and I've noticed only 1 female employee is available. (This is exactly why I call ahead.) They offer us tea or water while we soaked. They left us soaking for about 10 minutes. (I hope they don't count this as part of our hour and luckily, they didn't! It's happened to us before!) Another female arrives and they both get to work. I had LINDA and the Husband had BELLA. Linda was great! I made the mistake of declining a private single room when she offered it and now I know why. It was a pretty cramped area for her to work around as I was seated against the wall. She had to make the long trek around the other chairs to move from my head to my feet since there was  a table blocking her pathway. So that was my mistake. She did some pretty great scalp work, which I definitely appreciate it. She also does some stretching. But my favorite was her back work. She does more of a back rolling pressure massage which is what I needed, but then she kneeled on my back and put all her weight in. Mind blown! It was pretty freakin' awesome. When the Husband's massage girl tried talking to mine, she shushed her. Gotta love that! (The Husband says I usually get the chatty ones, which I detest.) When my massage was done, I told the Husband that I was leaving a bigger tip. He agreed that he would be too! He was similarly impressed with Bella's back work as well. For the Basic service, I was quite pleased. It's pretty rare when we both are equally impressed with our massage people.At the beginning of my session, the front desk guy comes by to let me know that if I need anything, to let Linda know. I take this opportunity to tell him there's no more soap in the restroom.  He didn't understand and so I repeated myself. He seemed to understand and said he would take care of it right away. So, of course at the end of my session, I just had to check to see if they got soap. Nope! C'mon! I gave the guy over an hour to buy some soap and it didn't happen! When we went to pay, I told him again there was no soap in the restroom. Again, he didn't understand and I repeated myself. Then it seemed like he understood and relayed something to Linda. Ultimately, no business should ever run out of soap! They do accept credit cards, but there's a 50 cent charge. It's posted, but it would have been nice to be told this since the Husband only realized it when he signed the credit card slip. The guy did give us back our 50 cents though. 5 stars for Linda and Bella but 2 stars for the facilities and no soap! Buy some soap and remove a massage bed so it's not so cramped. 3.5 stars overallThey offer a frequent visitor card - Get 10 foot massages and get 1 free.",6,3,-4F4oh1gEUF3-5BG8OuHwA,9/28/2015,4,3,35,Health & Medical

But since the Baby was born, it was time to go back to getting some serious work done and Best Foot Spa was calling!First off, I chose this place because it was blowing up on Yelp at the time and second of all, the famous Rex opened this place up.  So, I had to go where he was and experience his magical hand, right?It was my mom and I on this experience and we made appointments just in case.  We were led into a semi-private space with two chairs.  Rex worked on me while my mom had Lee.  As with all of good foot massage places, your feet start off in a hot bath while they work on you head, neck and shoulders.  Then they eventually move onto your feet and then have you sit up to work on your shoulders before having you flip over and lie down!  Yep, lie down I tell you!  I love it when they tell me to flip over and lie down!  (Not all Vegas foot massage places offer this ""flip over"" business!)  That's when they get to working on your back and pushing you this way and that way while your face is in this hole.  This is what I was looking for!One of the cool things they have are hooks for your purse and jackets - nice touch.  It's the little things that matter!I definitely appreciated that Rex makes a point of looking at the clock when he starts and telling you what time it is so there's no confusion about that.  (Unlike a few other places that claim you're getting a 60 minute treatment, but it's really 50.)At the end of our service, Rex assures me that it's always the same people working there - himself, Lee, Elaine (or Eileen) and Carol.  I think this is because there are so many places that contract workers here and there.  So that makes me feel that you are certain of getting a specific kind of experience there.They also offer a Yelp discount too! 4.5 stars.* Update! (09.20.11)Going down to a 4 star rating.  Lee worked on me last night and although he was good, the smell of cigarette smoke is very distracting.  I hate to have to ask ahead of time if the person working on me is a smoker or not, but I have a strong sense of smell!  That put me off from the very beginning.  Also, Rex took a call while he was working on the Husband.  Yes, I know it's business and all, but very distracting and a big pet peeve of ours.  Get someone else to handle the phones please. Right before they started working on our feet, they mentioned that they could make my feet like a baby's butt...for an additional 30 minutes and a $29 charge.  It includes a hot wax...which I assume is a parafin wax dip. Although I love having my feet super soft, we had to pass this time around.",12,7,sKosVzKNcwUBqJc4RMyElA,6/30/2011,4,3,31,Health & Medical

We always welcome a little healthy competition, even if Vegas does seem a bit over saturated with foot massage places.  We aren't always so anxious to make the drive to Spring Mountain to get some foot work done.The Husband noticed the sign driving on S. Rainbow and with only two yelp reviews, we were a bit hesitant.  We called ahead to find out the prices and to see if there was any availability.  They normally charge $38/hr, but with the Yelp discount - it's $34.  (They are currently offering a Yelp Deal too - $15 for $20 towards service, which I doubt you can combine.)We didn't make an appointment but were the only ones there last night.  Angel warmly greeted us and had us take a seat amongst the handful of chairs in the main room.  As she went to get us our tea, she hastily made a few calls getting her employees in as they had gone on an errand.  She told us about her business, gave us some information on Pure Foot & Spa and reflexology, and asked us what we thought of the interior decorating.  She had our feet soaking in the hot water while we waited, so we didn't mind.  It wasn't too long when one of the ladies returned.  She immediately got started on the Husband, so Angel started working on me while I waited for my guy to return.  As her delicate hands started working on my face, I was almost hoping my guy didn't return.  (There are some people that have gentle hands, and she's one of them.)  After a few minutes, my guy did arrive and he got started on me.Everything was pretty straightforward from them on - they work on your head, neck, and shoulders before heading to your feet and calves.  And after wiping down your feet, they flip you over so you get some back work.  One thing I really appreciate here is that they actually spend a good amount of time on your feet and calves.  Sometimes other places focus more on shoulders, but my feet and calves were what needed the attention and they got it.  Usually, I can tell the Husband is having a good experience when I hear him snoring.  This time, I didn't hear him snore at all, so I was concerned.  I was pleasantly surprised when he asked the name of his lady though because he obviously wanted to remember who she was.  Overall, we were both quite happy with our experience at Pure Foot and definitely glad to have them in the neighborhood.  We'll definitely be going back again!He had EVA and I had IVAN.* They charge $1 to use your credit card.  I recommend calling to make an appointment to be sure.

(Of course, this is not to be confused with the service also known as body shampoos found at places with questionable intentions.)When inquiring about this service, we were led passed the chairs reserved for foot massages and into the back room.  This room had three massage beds with sinks specifically built attached to them.  The Husband and I then had our shoulders covered with a towel and plastic to prevent those areas from getting wet and we laid down with our heads over the sink.  This is where the similarities ended.The person I had was Mark.  I have long hair.  He started to massage my scalp for a little while before turning the water on to wet my hair.  He then shampooed my hair and spent a considerable amount of time 'scratching' my scalp.  This is something that can be enjoyable and quite relaxing depending on the person and the circumstance, but it was just okay this time.  He then also did some cranial pressure before rinsing my hair of the shampoo and applying conditioner.  He made a point of making sure my hair was completely conditioned as he ran a comb through it all.  And then he rinsed all the conditioner out and squeezed some of the water out of my hair.  I was then instructed to get up so we could walk to a smaller room where he would blow dry my hair.  He then dried my hair and ran a brush through it to get rid of any tangles.  And then I was done.  Unfortunately, my hair was still a bit damp and the bottom half of my shirt in the back was all wet from the walk from the sink to the blow drying room.  (Perhaps he could have wrapped my hair in a towel to prevent that from happening.)  He apologized for the wet shirt part but I had to go blow dry my shirt as a result.  3 stars.Meanwhile, the Husband has practically no hair and he had Reao.  He said he didn't get that much scratching, but more pressure on his scalp, face, and shoulders.  While I was getting my hair blow dried, he was still getting cranial work done.  He felt so relaxed that he almost fell asleep.  He tried to inquire about what other services would take place if we had chosen the 60 minute option, but Reao did not quite understand him.  She thought he was trying to extend his experience to the 60 minute one.  He wanted to know if they were going to focus more on the scalp, shoulders, or face.  He really enjoyed it and would do it again.  4.5 stars from him.I think I lost out on the experience because: a) I had a guy.  (And unfortunately I believe he smelled of cigarette smoke.  So with my sensitive sense of smell, and him running his hands through my hair, it was distracting.)  b) I have long hair.  Because so much time was spent shampooing, conditioning, and blow drying, there was less time for cranial work. Yes, I know it's called a head shampoo but you know you're really there for good cranial work.  It's almost like a glorified hair shampooing experience at your local salon.  Overall, I think if you're a bald guy, you may just love it.  Half the experience at a hair salon is getting your head shampooed and massaged and this place focuses on that part.  Unfortunately, I just didn't get that many head tingles from the experience like I was hoping for!  Would I go back?  Maybe - if I cut my hair and/or if I get a girl next time.  Some girls just know how to massage the scalp better, maybe it's the nail thing? 30 minutes = $2560 minutes = $4860 minutes combo = $45 (30 minute head shampoo and 30 minute reflexology)They are located exactly next door to Ichiza.

Once Mav made his appearance, we stayed at the hospital another 48 hours or so, and all of the hospital staff we dealt with there were wonderful as well.  One thing to note is that this hospital does not have a nursery.  Once your baby arrives, you are in the same room as the baby... nurses are there to help, but you can't just ""send the baby to the nursery,"" as I hear you can do at other hospitals.  I was sleep deprived, but I didn't mind this as I was able to bond with Maverick right away.Other perks that I was impressed with were the size of the rooms, the fact that everything appeared clean and sanitized, the ""room service"" from the hospital cafeteria, the snacks available to patients, the videos available to help prepare you for being a parent, etc... but again, I cannot stress enough how impressed I was with the nurses.  Special kudos to Pam for getting me started and visiting after the baby came, Maggie for coaching me through the pushing, Cassie for her integral help post delivery, and all of the rest of the staff who I can't mention by name because I was in a drugged / hormonal state during my stay at this hospital.I'm not a huge fan of hospitals in general, but again, I had a fabulous experience here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hospital to anyone.",21,17,BL9ZQwgS0L1piT6-bnc6kw,9/15/2011,5,8,49,Health & Medical

Dr. Bartels delivered my son 6 years ago and Dr. Webb delivered my daughter 4.5 years ago.  I'll forever be grateful for the care they gave me throughout my pregnancies, labors and deliveries.  I'm such a fan of this practice by the way, that I was quoted in an Inc Magazine article in 2009.  I said, ""there are not too many people I trust to go 'down there,' but Dr. Bartels and Dr. Webb are on that list!""  They got the quote correct and I still feel the same.  The support staff are pleasant, but the doctors, PAs, nurses, ultrasound tech, etc... are wonderful.  Ultrasounds are not as exciting without a baby on the way, but it's still comfortable to visit Charlotte periodically, and I've since added some visits to see Yael, the Aesthetician (she is fabulous), and Debbie, the RN that handles aesthetic injections on occasion (ie: Botox but don't tell anyone!).  It's rare to find someone like Debbie who has 30+ years of diverse nursing experience and is still super passionate about what she does.If you're looking for a standard GYN practice with caring doctors and staff, and/or perhaps a little something more (ie: vaginal rejuvenation, aesthetic procedures, hormone therapy), this place has what you're looking for.

So there isn't much that would live up to the Tucson location, but the SpaClub at the Venetian comes close.  I worked out a couple of the days in their facility and even took a couple of classes - a body strength and a 'fit tease' - both were decent workouts and fun too!  Now that the workout is covered, on to the pampering... My mom, sister, and I all planned ahead and we each had a massage on one day and a facial the next.  Mom and Aubs had the signature Canyon Ranch massage and I decided to change it up and went with the Thai Yoga massage - all were phenomenal!  We were all invigorated after our services and we were each given a 'healthy living card' from our therapists on our way out... what a nice touch!

This was because we noticed that at three and four years old, she was having difficulty pronouncing certain letters and sounds.We were referred to PSLS from our pre-school director and had an initial evaluation in July of 2017.    Sure enough, the evaluation concluded that speech therapy ""appears medically necessary due to an articulation disorder.""  It was recommended that our daughter participate in 30-minute sessions of speech therapy for a minimum of two sessions per week, as well as practicing at home.As a result of the evaluation, we also learned that there was no reason our daughter couldn't easily catch up to age appropriate verbal communication in a reasonable amount of time.  We also learned there were no physical barriers stopping our daughter from pronouncing anything, which was a relief.   In reading everything I've written above, it sounds very serious and clinical and like there is a major issue at hand.  Luckily, that is not so... our daughter is perfect (at least in my eyes) and while maybe she doesn't annunciate every word as she should, she sounds like any other four year old out there.  She just needs to practice a little bit more and luckily, she has grown to love going to her speech sessions with Miss Amy, her therapist.PSLS does a great job of balancing a warm and friendly environment with a team of professionals who are super knowledgeable in their field.  They can speak in layman's terms to the patients and parents but obviously have a clinical background as well.I've been pleased with the staff working with my pediatrician and insurance company as well as with the progress I've seen to date with our sessions.While I hope that my daugher will ""graduate"" and no longer need therapy after a few more months, I'm grateful to have found PSLS, to help bring her up to speed before she enters elementary school.If you are seeking a place to take a child who may need some therapy or are curious to get an evaluation, PSLS is a practice I'd definitely recommend.",8,7,z2JC6nnmDo7lebTYfjBPiw,10/5/2017,5,4,33,Health & Medical

Next the facial began and she talked / educated me just enough so that I could relax and enjoy but learn a little something too... several scrubs, a partial pumpkin peel, a mask, exfoliation, and moisturizer later, I was given a choice: hands, feet, or neck and shoulders.  I chose feet.  Deep exhale.  No words can explain how amazing this was.  I didn't want my time to end, but it did... :(And as I type this, I wish that Alvea Spa was just a bit closer to home.

We were really looking forward to spending a few hours being pampered, perhaps working out a bit, sitting by the pool, etc... and we did all that - it just didn't WOW me as much as I thought it would for the price I paid.First of all, I was very clear when I made the appointments that my friend was pregnant and so I requested a prenatal massage for her.  I requested a deep tissue massage for myself.  I was pleased that they called the day before to confirm our appointments.  We checked in about an hour before our scheduled massages and the lady looked at us both and asked ""so, you both have prenatal massages, correct?""WHAT?  NO!  I looked down at my belly and said - nope - she has a prenatal massage and I requested a deep tissue massage.  Not a huge deal and probably not the girl's fault, but that is not a mistake to make to someone who is weight-conscious and far from prego!No big deal... we're here to enjoy and relax.  Deep breath, Gabi... :)So we are given a tour of the facility (which is beautiful, peaceful, tranquil, etc...) and we decide we have time for a walk before our massages.  So, we go outside and make our way around the hotel a bit.  There is a bunch of construction, so we turn around and go through the hotel and try to go to the back pool area to check it out.  Nope... the pool attendant says that spa guests cannot enter that pool area (not even for a walk) - you must be a hotel guest to enter.  OK then, we turn around and head back to the spa.With about a 1/2 hour before we need to be ready for our massages, we decide to get in a quick workout in the fitness center.  It is clean, spacious for a hotel facility, and has all the equipment you need.  This was a positive, as was the actual spa pool and jacuzzi, sauna, etc...Once we are in our robes and slippers, we head upstairs for our treatments - the waiting room is very well-done with comfy couches, chairs, blankets, plenty of magazines, relaxing music, and lots of treats (fruit, tea, water, trail mix, etc.)The services didn't blow either of us away and for what we paid, we each could've gotten 4 massages each at Massage Envy instead.  But, again, it was about the day as a whole and the spa experience.  So, we enjoyed a lovely lunch from the Spa Bistro and sat out by the pool in the afternoon.  Not such a bad day after all - I just really wanted a 5 star experience for what we paid, and I can't give more than 4.  However, it is hit or miss, so I encourage you to check it out yourself.

They have to move on to their next client, after all.  The down side is that unless you find a therapist that you really love, you take the risk of getting a therapist that is not amazing.

Unfortunately, when I do find a therapist I really like, it seems they move on quite often, and then I'm back to the drawing board.Even so, I plan on continuing my membership since the $$ I pay each month is worth it in my eyes.

ROOM #4: Finnish Sauna (Dry Heat Room)Not a fan of dry heat rooms as I feel like I'm stuck in a charcoal bbq minus the charcoal. ROOM #5: Crystal Steam Room (Aromatherapy Steam Room)Saving the best for last! The aromatherapy steam room is less intense than the Herbal Laconium room and the fragrant floral scents will enhance your mood. THE QUIET ROOM/LOUNGEEnd your Aquavana Session at the quiet room where you can lay on plushy oversized sofas while reading trashy magazines and munching on fresh apples, bananas and oranges. It was so quiet and serene that I ended up taking a 10-minute power nap. I woke up refreshed with my pounding headache all gone!SHOWER/MAKEUP ROOM*10-15 private showers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash in each one*Personal sink area with lotions, deodorant, hair care products, hair dryer, combs, brushes, etc*If you need a curling iron or flat iron, you can get it at the front deskTIP: If you need a razer, shower cap, and/or towels, make sure to grab them before getting into the shower room. They're located near the entrance way to the showers.OVERALL LAYOUTThe CRSC is BIG and I didn't even know how big until I got lost and ended up on the men's side. It's confusing to say the least and it was like a maze to get out. If you suffer from ""Waking Up In Vegas"" syndrome like I always seem to, I highly recommend coming to the CRSC to get you out of your funk!",12,3,dPXJNnBIYeIETYy01Euvbg,2/28/2011,3,7,23,Health & Medical

Red Rock's luxurious facility both surprised and impressed me - there's a lot to do!This casino resort has a cornucopia of features, including a bowling alley, spa, food court, multiple Restaurant, and conference center capabilities. Their hotel lobby lounge features a 32-foot long chandelier, draped by an elegant staircase. There's a few stores, and a Starbucks overlooking the lobby. The casino's decor is sharp, and the Restaurant lining it mirror that theme. The nearly 3,000 slot machines can confound if you're trying to find people, so pay attention to your surroundings.We had a spacious suite near the spa, with a view of the Strip and top-notch amenities: modern decor, huge soft mattresses, a comfy couch, a widescreen plasma TV, and a convenient bottle of Patron (costs extra). Loved the bathroom, and the luxurious shower. The toilet had a phone by it, and the marble tub, a TV. Besides hearing wind whistling one morning (it was crazy windy out there), Red Rock's hotel, casino, and lounges all had a fit and finish that made our dollars feel well-spent.Hotel service was stellar. When I needed help late-night, both Tanya (at the front desk) and a bellhop assisted. When we needed a random feminine hygiene product, not only did room service stock necessities, a staffer delivered the goods to our door minutes later. When hunger hit, concierge Stephanie pointed out some nearby Thai Restaurant.If you're planning on heading to the Strip, keep in mind that Red Rock is off-strip. If you're content with hailing a taxi, or are a local, this shouldn't be an issue.My single regret from my stay at Red Rock?

Just like Nicole C - said - Qua Spa is the Ultimate.The treatments are a little pricey - but I've heard they're well worth it.  (Connie loved her massage). Nicole and I decided to just use the facilities.

Pure aqua bliss. You can spend all day dipping your body in each, and once your body is relaxed and revitalized by the mineral enriched waters,  you can grab the latest gossip magazine and lounge on the reclined hot stone chairs, which heat up your core - allowing for one of the best naps you'll ever take.If you're done sitting poolside, you can then head to the lounge area, to grab some fruity hot and cold teas (all teas throughout the spa are organically grown with only natural ingredients and flavors ). One thoroughly hydrated, you can wrap your robe tightly around you, as you make your way to the next heavenly phase in the adventure - the Laconium and Arctic Ice Room.The Laconium room is the sauna. It's the perfect place to clear your pores and sweat out any vodka and redbulls injested the night before.  Lying back on the wooden benches, you feel your body become lifeless, as your forehead heats up. Once throughly warmed - you head to the Arctic Room.The Arctic Ice Room has heated floors and benches where you can sit perched as you watch snow fall before you. It's soothing, and magical, and takes you back to the excitement you felt when young. Utter awe at the early signs of resh falling winter.Feeling the chill, you emerge from the brisk world  - back into Qua reality  - an amazing shower with high quality shampoo and conditioner (Qua even has a handy contraption to get the water out of your bathing suit in a matter of seconds)Feeling alive, awake, and amazing  - you slather yourself in moisturizer, brush your hair, get dressed, and leave Qua a better and healthier person.If you're going to Vegas - go big.

Everything from the regular sized rooms to the mega suites that could sleep 30, are available and for far more reasonable prices than most of the ones along Las Vegas Blvd. And at nearly 500 of them, there is plenty to choose from. I say, try to score a room near their pools - the view of the strip is nice, as is the amenities poolside.Casino enthusiasts should be able to appreciate the large casino space, which offers over 70 table games and over 2,000 gaming machines. Blackjack fans should be able to get their fill of over 30 tables dedicated to the game and poker fans will have a  decent variety of games to chose from as well. Their player rewards program is competitive, comp points from play is definitely transferrable to other Station properties. Dealers are usually quite friendly and the cigarette smoke is controlled rather well for a large space. The cocktail staff could definitely use an upgrade, but I digress.In terms of eats, there is a decent selection but the outstanding venues are a bit limited. Hank's Steaks & Martinis (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson) is the obvious winner of the bunch and then there is the pitiful TIdes Oyster Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tides-oyster-bar-henderson). I echo the pains of eating at Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-cafe-henderson) though the Feast (Around The World) Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/feast-buffet-henderson-3) has been fantastic and mediocre at varying times. It's no In-N-Out, but Fatburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fatburger-henderson-2) is gut bustingly good. Sushi + Sake (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-sake-las-vegas) is a fun time, especially for their AYCE deal. Italian joint Terra Verde (http://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-verde-henderson) is decent during lunch, though I much preferred it when Hell's Kitchen winner Rock was still running the show.GVR has a lot of random amenities, which really distinguish it from it's nearby (or far away depending on how you look at it) properties. Like the Red Rock, there is a movie theater. The Pond (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pond-henderson), is a real cool and relaxing alternative to their sick pools. A great place to catch an outdoor concert is at The Backyard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-backyard-henderson) and Ovation (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovation-henderson) is a real concert venue. Every casino has a center floor bar and in GVR's case, it's the Drop Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/drop-bar-henderson). I'd also recommend visiting the Lobby Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobby-bar-henderson) as it's probably the closest thing to a club GVR has. The property may not boast a lot of shopping, but it sits right next to The District (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-district-at-green-valley-ranch-henderson), a village of boutique and luxury stores, just perfect for those looking for an escape from the casino. It's rarely ever crowded, but then again, neither is the casino.Though GVR could probably use an upgrade on a few things, the property itself is good enough to warrant a 4.5 star rating. It's versatile, stylish, and spacious enough for all visitors. Folks who are teetering the idea of staying off the strip with almost everything at their disposal, should consider GVR as their next destination.___________(#1) This is a very, very good thing.",5,2,1ekmjgWn1knK55pbyH_1Kg,1/8/2012,5,2,68,Beauty & Spa

Posh, luxurious in its own way, there are too many good adjectives to describe Station's finest casino in the land.  Its places like the Red Rock that will eventually lead people off the overrated strip and into places like this and Green Valley Ranch.Situated near the Red Rock Canyon, this secluded resort may seem far from a lot of things, but as a boutique resort, they have all the bases covered for people with all kinds of interest.  Ever since its expansion of the second tower at the end of 2006, the dramatic difference can be felt in the hotel's beautiful rooms and expanded convention space.This is a locals casino destination and becoming more and more popular by the day.  Virtually everything is great here, from the food to the pool to the relaxed casino.  Nightlife is decent with plenty of eye candy over at Cherry Nightclub and the trendy Restaurant within the casino are great.  Suites are spacious, well decorated, and very comfortable.  And by comfortable, I mean probably one of the best beds I've ever slept in.Few resort properties like this have impressed me to the magnitude that Red Rock has.  This place has it all and is an ideal family destination with plenty of food options (larger food court), a fabulous theater, and probably one of the best bowling alleys in Vegas.  Comped players will enjoy their stay, in addition to the visitors who are just looking for a place to get away.  As one of Vegas' most underrated properties, the Red Rock is without a doubt one of the town's best.",9,9,xHArSOVpxZ5XdGP4sMVLUg,4/25/2008,5,4,53,Beauty & Spa

When we called, we asked how much it was for a session and were told $38, and asked us how we found out about them. When we said Yelp, they said that it will be $34/hour. When we got there, we were ushered into a dimly lit room with comfortable armchairs to sit in. A big wooden tub is brought out with a plastic bag lined and filled with hot water to soak our feet in. My masseuse was Anna who immediately went to work on my back and shoulders. After about 10 mins on my upper back, I felt myself relax and slump over the cushions she had placed on my lap.I've had Chinese foot massage before but they've always hurt me so badly I couldn't go about my daily duties for a few days. There was none of this here. Anna exerted enough pressure, yet, was not torturing me with pain.My friend wanted a 75 minute treatment so all 3 of us did as well. We had a good 30 minutes of back, neck and shoulder massage and then she moved onto your head, scalp and ears before doing the arms, hands and fingers. When that was finished she started working on my feet and toes. I actually fell asleep can you believe it? I've NEVER fallen asleep during one of these before.She then massaged my legs and then laid 3 ottomans together so we could lay on it face-down so she could work on my back. Throughout the treatment, I was drinking the herbal tea they had provided -- I suggest you do this because it will make you go and pee to flush out all the toxins in your body.When it was all over, I stood up and was wobbly. I lost my balance slightly because I was so relaxed. I'm going to give them 5 stars for the treatment, but am taking off a star because I didn't realize until later, they never gave us the Yelp discount. We received 15 minutes of extra treatment and were charged $48. We were told the Yelp discount would make the one hour treatment $34, so an extra 15 minutes should not cost 14 extra dollars. Still, I will return here again when we go to Vegas next and I hope Anna is still there when I return!

Their levels of sobriety ranged from stone cold to having smoked an ounce in the parking lot.  I was somewhere in between.      The friendly attendant, John, clearly explained what to do and how to operate the pod.  Being a first timer, I also watched a 6 minute video on how to maximize my float time which offered some helpful suggestions (body position, breathing) while glazing over some new age, self improvement stuff.  John also informed me to hang in their relaxation room upon finishing since many feel disoriented and extremely euphoric afterwards.  Uhhh..what??

I could not believe I was in the pod for only an hour as it felt much longer than that.They claim health benefits like the improvement of memory/sports performance/sleep quality, alleviating PMS, helping with creativity, softer skin etc.  Let me tell you....my PMS was fuckin loooong gooooone!!!  :P  I don't know about this experience helping with all that, but I definitely left in a prolonged state of relaxation.

After being sick of contacts and glasses for 15+ years, she finally wanted to get it done.After some research and speaking with a few facilities, it seemed like the best choice was either here or Lasik of Nevada.  We chose Siems based on our talk with the consultant, price for the exact same treatment and also their proximity to our home.  My wife didn't want to schlep it all the way to Henderson for follow ups.  Dr. Siems made us feel comfortable right away upon the first meeting.  His office is very nice.  The lobby feels spa-like.  Needless to say we were nervous when the big day finally came for her to get the procedure done.  You hear that there's a high 90% success rate but a person only has one pair of eyes.  Dr. Siems and his staff made my wife as comfortable as possible (valium helped).  I was able to view the whole procedure on a television outside of the operating room and it definitely made me wince a little when they cut the lens and started shooting the lasers in her eyes. The whole procedure took less than 30 minutes.  She then took another valium and slept for about 18 hours.  She was able to see very clearly the next day and it just improved from there.  Post operation checkups are included in the price so the day after, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year were all taken care of.  Now that it has been well over a year, she says it's one of the best things she's ever done in life.  I've worn glasses more than half of my life and feel like the fat guy at Mr Olympia or the dude with no tattoos in a tattoo parlor when I go in there.  They always ask me when I am going to do it.  I am still on the fence about getting it done myself but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate to go with Siems.",28,12,PeYoFeu4UYMxX9pFqZAt2w,3/5/2013,5,9,17,Beauty & Spa

Paolo D, Regina P, David S and Julie S all give very helpful and detailed reviews on how it'll all go down so you should read them.  I have a few things to add:- Bring flip flops.  They didn't supply them for me and I walked around barefoot the whole time.  It wasn't bad but I was running out of a couple of the sauna rooms really quickly since the floor was hot.   - No option for bathing suits.  You will be naked with everyone else.  I am very near sighted so everyone looks like they've been blurred out for public television.- Be VERY careful when getting into one of the beds in the red clay ball room.  It's like walking on a hundred marbles and the floor is not forgiving.  I wiped out pretty bad and strained my MCL.  My doctor said I'll be fine in a week.  Thanks to all that laughed at me (wife included).  I am going butt in first the next time.  - The signs say to use each sauna on the 2nd floor for 3-7 minutes.  You can definitely do a little longer than that.  But one guy fell asleep in the red clay ball room (you could hear him snoring) and I am guessing he was in there for a solid hour.  He looked like a total disaster when he came out.  Stay hydrated!- I never do this but I paid $1 for the 3 minute massage chairs.  There were 2 types.  One was the standard massage which was decent and the other was the ""slimming massage chair"" which was ridiculous.  The latter just started shaking your butt from left to right, up and down like you were going through terrible airplane turbulence and it also crushed your calves.  Definitely avoid that one.I know it sounds like I am just complaining but there's a lot to like about Imperial.  The steam rooms are great.  I enjoyed sitting in the sheer heat of the herbal steam room only to jump into the cold tub as soon as I got out.  It felt so refreshing!

Thank you Yelp for sending me their way!Belly Bliss is a combination of things - a boutique store for mamas-to-be (and future dads), a spa, and offers classes and groups that are related to pregnancy and babies.Recently, I went specifically to experience their spa services.  Taking advantage of their seasonal specials, I got the Joyful Package for $170.  It consisted of a 60 minute ""Girls Getaway"" massage and a 90 minute signature ""Body in Balance"" facial treatment.  Joann M. was my massage therapist and Margo S. was my aesthetician.  Because this place specializes in working with pregnant woman, they make every attempt to make sure that you are comfortable during all your treatments.  Tables easily adjust for the head and body and plenty of pillows and supports are available for your comfort.  Both were professional and friendly and you get the feeling they both really enjoy working with all their pregnant clients. (Margo told me to come back again and bring the baby!)  Sure, there are plenty of spas in town that offer prenatal massage, but you end up paying an upcharge to use their facilities.  When in actuality, most pregnant women are discouraged from using the jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc.  So you end up feeling a bit short changed when all you wanted was some personal body work done.  Belly Bliss gives you just that without all the frills.  They only have a few treatments rooms available, so it shouldn't be crowded when you go.Once your treatment is done, you can help yourself to their little snack bar where you can fill a take out box full of pretzels, goldfish crackers, lollipops, and raisins.  Plenty of spa water and apples are available too.Getting treatments done on Tuesdays also gives you 10% off your spa services!  Sweet!  Apparently, free eyebrow waxes and foot massages are available on Tuesdays as well.  Call ahead to confirm and make reservations! You can't help but take a look through their store on your way out.  So many cool and useful items are available for you to check out and purchase.  It can be a bit dangerous actually!Belly Bliss is located on the 2nd floor of the Desert Perinatal Associates office, so doctors are only a few steps away if you're really concerned about anything.Classes include Breastfeeding, Yoga (Pre and Postnatal), Newborn Care and Immunization, Baby Massage, How to Select a Childcare Facility, and Childbirth Education.  Medela breast pumps are available for rental too! They also have party rental space if you want to plan a baby shower or private party at their facility.Gift certificates are available and any pregnant girl would be happy to receive a service from Belly Bliss!  Husbands, boyfriends, fathers, partners, friends - check this place out and give a great gift for a future mama!

I was first excited about them because they had raving reviews...but lately it's been going down so I definitely went in with some hesitation.First off, I've been trying to sign up for their email specials but have yet to receive anything (even though I signed up months ago).  The receptionist said they sent an email out in December, but I never got it.  Bummer.On their website, they have daily specials and I wanted to take advantage of one of them.  When I called in on a Thursday, the receptionist wasn't that familiar with what the special was or even if it was valid since they hadn't updated their website in awhile.  She eventually did look it up and it was supposed to be ""Free Nail Art with purchase of a pedicure.""  She said it was still valid and I went forward with booking our appointments.  I initially tried for a 4:00 appointment for two pedicures, the next available time was 5:00 pm, but she was able to get us both in at 4:45 pm.  We arrived a bit early so we could get situated and pick our our nail colors.  They were packed - all the workers had customers in front of them and the phone was ringing.  No kidding about making an appointment! There's also a self service cooler on the left - so help yourself! We were seated in the pedicure chairs by 4:50 pm, so there was no delay there.Now, I haven't been to too many nail salons, but I guess I'm used to be being taken care of.  The simplest thing like helping me into the pedicure chair, moving the arm rest out, helping me set down my beverage, and showing me how the massage chair works can really do wonders.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen here - and the sight of watching a 38 week pregnant girl stepping gingerly into the chair can be quite a sight.  A little assistance would have been really nice!  (Plus, we were carrying our purse, magazines, beverage, shoes, etc. - so we definitely didn't have any extra hands available.)After the Mom and I finally got settled into our chair and we figured out how the controls worked, we tried to relax for our little pampering session.  Diane (aka Mom) was assigned to take one of us and she chose me.  My pedicure got started and it was pretty standard.  Diane kept the conversation to a minimum, which was totally fine with me.  I did notice that she started cutting my cuticles and went for the baby toe first.  And yes, she made it bleed.  I could tell by the way she kept wiping it, covering it, getting the blue stuff to put on it, and then the way it would sting when I put my foot back into the water.  Hmmm...bleeding on the first toe?  Also, I think Diane might have had a cold or something because she was coughing (a lot) on my feet.  And all I could think about was thank goodness I wasn't getting a manicure too.  I completely forgot about the free nail art that I was supposed to get until after the fact.   Whereas the Mom had a younger girl working on her (Nicole) that was very chatty from the beginning.  At first, I thought she was talking to the Mom, but then I realized she was actually talking to another customer next to the Mom.  I learned later that the Mom didn't really appreciate that and wished Nicole had spent more time focusing on her and her feet instead of facing someone else and chatting with them.  She also mentioned that Nicole could have spent more time massaging her feet, which I would have to agree with too.The Mom was finished first, despite her starting later and having more work done.  Nicole sent her to the drying station so she could dry her toes further, whereas Diane just said she was all done.  I didn't really know where to go after that since there were only two chairs available in the drying area and they were both taken.There is a really young staff here and they are quite the social bunch - the employees do talk a lot amongst themselves (in English) and I guess it feels more like a hair salon with all the random banter going on regarding house stuff, weekend plans, etc.  They are extremely busy and walk-ins will get serviced, if you have something minor to take care of.  (Which sucks if that means your technician leaves you to take care of a walk-in.) They also have a referral program, but the new customer has to have the referral card with them for you to get any benefits from it.  Other promotions include:* Buy 4 Spa pedicures for $99 and get a mani/pedi free.  ($137 value)* Buy 4 Acrylic Fills for $75 and get a acrylic set free. ($100 value)* Buy 9 manicures for $99 and get two manicures free. ($132)You get 10% off your next appointment if you book immediately.It's been a week since I got my pedicure and my toes look pretty damn good still, so that's a major bonus point.  I wished she did scrub my feet more so they could be baby soft, but that didn't happen.  I did purchase one of their value cards, so I'll be going back at a less busier time I hope.3.5 stars.",6,4,F8XmJgYc-jZk1h0EzNb_rg,1/14/2011,4,0,44,Beauty & Spa

Choosing a weekday meant the spa would be empty, and it really was.  The staff were very welcoming as we entered after parking in the private lot in the back.  (This way you don't have to walk through the casino and hotel to get here.)Arriving early, we both settled in at our respective lounge areas, reading a magazine and grabbing a cup of tea.  When the attendants came for us, they brought us to the couples room for our treatments.  The room was on the same level as the pool, but hidden away.  It was a very nice size room and I only wish we had more treatments that would have allowed us to use the bathtub and outdoor shower.We both had the Stone Massage ""This light-pressure therapy combines traditional Swedish massage with use of warm, polished basalt stones strategically  placed on the body to promote circulation, boost the immune system and soften skin."" for 80 minutes of pure bliss.  It was just lovely.  Our two therapists had slightly different techniques, but we both left very pleased with our treatments.We had initially wanted their Shirodhara Hot Stone Massage and Shirodhara Scalp Experience, but were told when booking that they are still training the therapists in these types of techniques.  We were a bit bummed about that.After our treatments were finished, we sat outside by the spa pool and lazed around on a cabana.  We also ordered lunch (portabello mushroom burger and mini chili cheese hot dogs) along with some pricey alcoholic drinks.  We swam in the lap pool, sat in the steam room, jacuzzied, and eventually headed back downstairs to the spa.We then spent time in the co-ed areas, which included a lounge room, an outdoor area, and a jacuzzi.  This is one of the best things about The Spa at Green Valley Ranch Resort - their coed areas.  Yes, some people could care less about this stuff, but for us, we were looking for areas where we could spend time together and this spa offered those spaces.There is a co-ed fitness center available if you're so inclined too.Back in our own locker rooms, I enjoyed the jacuzzi, the steam room, and the lounge. I even tried out this machine that vibrated my body that targeted different regions.When we were done, we felt quite relaxed.  It was a good day for us.  Yes, it can get a bit pricey, so check out their website for rotating promotions going on.  When we went, it was Buy One, Get One Free.  So that was a nice perk.

I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)  I will definitely be going back there again though because we bought the gift cards!",20,14,7eN2z5q4Hy-3A0J-4Ld87g,3/28/2013,5,9,37,Beauty & Spa

Where does one begin with the plethora of foot massage places along Spring Mountain? I took a chance and called The Foot Spa. I inquired if they had 2 females available in five minutes and they said yes. After explaining our options between the Basic ($20/hr) or Deep Tissue ($30/hr), and Yelp 'specials', we settled on the Basic. (Basic is more footwork whereas Deep Tissue is more back work.)We were led into the main room that has about 7 massage beds. I went to the restroom first and noticed they were out of soap. I took the time to open the dispenser in hopes that they 'just' ran out. Nope. Nothing in there. I even checked under the sink and found 3 more empty soap bottles! I was desperate and added some water and shook it just to get something soapy to wash my hands with. I reported back to the Husband with my discovery and was surprised he didn't suggest leaving. Buckets of hot water arrived for our feet to soak and I've noticed only 1 female employee is available. (This is exactly why I call ahead.) They offer us tea or water while we soaked. They left us soaking for about 10 minutes. (I hope they don't count this as part of our hour and luckily, they didn't! It's happened to us before!) Another female arrives and they both get to work. I had LINDA and the Husband had BELLA. Linda was great! I made the mistake of declining a private single room when she offered it and now I know why. It was a pretty cramped area for her to work around as I was seated against the wall. She had to make the long trek around the other chairs to move from my head to my feet since there was  a table blocking her pathway. So that was my mistake. She did some pretty great scalp work, which I definitely appreciate it. She also does some stretching. But my favorite was her back work. She does more of a back rolling pressure massage which is what I needed, but then she kneeled on my back and put all her weight in. Mind blown! It was pretty freakin' awesome. When the Husband's massage girl tried talking to mine, she shushed her. Gotta love that! (The Husband says I usually get the chatty ones, which I detest.) When my massage was done, I told the Husband that I was leaving a bigger tip. He agreed that he would be too! He was similarly impressed with Bella's back work as well. For the Basic service, I was quite pleased. It's pretty rare when we both are equally impressed with our massage people.At the beginning of my session, the front desk guy comes by to let me know that if I need anything, to let Linda know. I take this opportunity to tell him there's no more soap in the restroom.  He didn't understand and so I repeated myself. He seemed to understand and said he would take care of it right away. So, of course at the end of my session, I just had to check to see if they got soap. Nope! C'mon! I gave the guy over an hour to buy some soap and it didn't happen! When we went to pay, I told him again there was no soap in the restroom. Again, he didn't understand and I repeated myself. Then it seemed like he understood and relayed something to Linda. Ultimately, no business should ever run out of soap! They do accept credit cards, but there's a 50 cent charge. It's posted, but it would have been nice to be told this since the Husband only realized it when he signed the credit card slip. The guy did give us back our 50 cents though. 5 stars for Linda and Bella but 2 stars for the facilities and no soap! Buy some soap and remove a massage bed so it's not so cramped. 3.5 stars overallThey offer a frequent visitor card - Get 10 foot massages and get 1 free.",6,3,-4F4oh1gEUF3-5BG8OuHwA,9/28/2015,4,3,35,Beauty & Spa

But since the Baby was born, it was time to go back to getting some serious work done and Best Foot Spa was calling!First off, I chose this place because it was blowing up on Yelp at the time and second of all, the famous Rex opened this place up.  So, I had to go where he was and experience his magical hand, right?It was my mom and I on this experience and we made appointments just in case.  We were led into a semi-private space with two chairs.  Rex worked on me while my mom had Lee.  As with all of good foot massage places, your feet start off in a hot bath while they work on you head, neck and shoulders.  Then they eventually move onto your feet and then have you sit up to work on your shoulders before having you flip over and lie down!  Yep, lie down I tell you!  I love it when they tell me to flip over and lie down!  (Not all Vegas foot massage places offer this ""flip over"" business!)  That's when they get to working on your back and pushing you this way and that way while your face is in this hole.  This is what I was looking for!One of the cool things they have are hooks for your purse and jackets - nice touch.  It's the little things that matter!I definitely appreciated that Rex makes a point of looking at the clock when he starts and telling you what time it is so there's no confusion about that.  (Unlike a few other places that claim you're getting a 60 minute treatment, but it's really 50.)At the end of our service, Rex assures me that it's always the same people working there - himself, Lee, Elaine (or Eileen) and Carol.  I think this is because there are so many places that contract workers here and there.  So that makes me feel that you are certain of getting a specific kind of experience there.They also offer a Yelp discount too! 4.5 stars.* Update! (09.20.11)Going down to a 4 star rating.  Lee worked on me last night and although he was good, the smell of cigarette smoke is very distracting.  I hate to have to ask ahead of time if the person working on me is a smoker or not, but I have a strong sense of smell!  That put me off from the very beginning.  Also, Rex took a call while he was working on the Husband.  Yes, I know it's business and all, but very distracting and a big pet peeve of ours.  Get someone else to handle the phones please. Right before they started working on our feet, they mentioned that they could make my feet like a baby's butt...for an additional 30 minutes and a $29 charge.  It includes a hot wax...which I assume is a parafin wax dip. Although I love having my feet super soft, we had to pass this time around.",12,7,sKosVzKNcwUBqJc4RMyElA,6/30/2011,4,3,31,Beauty & Spa

They asked if we could wait five minutes and we took a seat.  The first things I noticed was how dark it was, creating a more relaxed atmosphere than other places.  As other employees were finishing up, they came out to the front and greeted us.  Their hushed tones added to the quietness of this place, and we both appreciated how friendly everyone was.  And they asked if we wanted anything to drink before our treatments.We were seated shortly in our semi-private room for two.  They brought out a hot herbal bath for our feet to soak in and came around behind us to start working.  (Yay - no wasted time here!)  As they start working on our neck and shoulders, they ask how long we would like.  We tell them we want 45 minutes, and they do try to persuade us for the 60 minute one, but we're okay right now.  For the next 15-20 minutes, the girls are working on our head, face, and neck.  My girl (Rosa) was scratching my scalp like no tomorrow and it was definitely getting me in the zone.  Aww...this is the perfect way to start - head first as your feet soak and then move down your body!When they come around to the front of us, they push our shoulders and arms for a bit before taking our feet out of the bath.  They also push your seat back so it reclines entirely.  After my feet are dried, she quickly dumps out the hot water bath and returns to get working.  She rubs some sort of ointment on my right foot before wrapping it up and then starts working on my left foot.  I am super relaxed now and I can hear the Husband breathing steadily next to me.  (Yes, he has fallen asleep, this is definitely a good sign!  May was working on him.)  I can feel myself wanting to fall asleep too because I am feeling pretty good.  Eventually, I do zone in and out of sleep, but just for a second.    They do move to my right foot eventually and I'm practically sleeping, so it all feels good.  After the massage, they wipe your calves and feet down with a hot towel.  They then roll down your pants legs and push on your legs and thighs a bit.  You sense the closing movements of your massage and are sad to know the time has come.  And they also offer us something to drink afterward instead of waiting around for a tip (like a few other places).They do a good job here, it's thorough and professional and there really are no complaints. (I would complain more about the other guests who talk very loudly because they are inconsiderate and do not realize we can hear everything of their conversation.  So please hush your voices when you enter!)  Also, when our girls did speak to each other, it was in hushed tones as well.They are busy and had a steady stream of customers coming in and out, which can be distracting.  The Husband says he prefers to go late at night when there's less foot traffic, and I will have to agree.They do accept VISA or MasterCard, but their credit card machine runs very slowly and is a bit of pain.  So, they prefer cash if possible.  They also have you sign your name in after the treatment as to keep track of their clients, which we find quite professional.We'll return here often, recommend others here, and probably go for the 60 minute one the next time we come.$28 for 45 minutes$38 for 60 minutes$48 for 75 minutes$55 for 90 minutes",12,6,x5SD7XDhn57XOxARlMFCxg,3/16/2009,4,4,25,Beauty & Spa

I'm not too picky with styles, so there's definitely some flexibility there should it not turn out too perfect.  The great thing about the hair services at Aveda is that it includes a stress relieving treatment, a hand and arm massage, make up touch up, and a mini facial.  (Although I have never been offered any kind of make up touch up whatsoever though.)Most recently, I returned for another haircut ($15) and a Botanical Hair Treatment ($20).  Much to my surprise, my haircut was free since I was donating it to Locks for Love!  Very cool!  (Looks like I may never have to pay for a haircut again then!)  This was obviously a newer service since I donated my hair the first time and they didn't know anything about it then.  Nice to see this new feature.Since I was using a Groupon, I needed to add a last minute service and was able to squeeze an Elemental Nature Pedicure ($25.50) while there.  The pedicure was just okay.  The girl who cut my hair also did the pedicure and I could tell she just didn't have a lot of experience with pedicures.  It's supposed ""to include grooming of nails, cuticles, exfoliation, massage, and treatment masque completed with polish."" First off, the exfoliation part - the paddle that they use to help scrub the bottoms she also used to scrub the tops of my feet.  Uh, ouch.  Delicate skin there! That was a huge sign of the rest of my experience.  I then mentioned that she might want to trim my nails first.  She either didn't hear me or ignored me because she chose to lightly file them instead.  (I thought maybe there weren't allowed to cut nails?)  She cleaned up the excess polish and all, but there's no place or machines to help dry them.  Off you go with those cheap paper thin sandal things.  (The worst part was that the sandal broke walking through the parking lot to the car, so now my clean feet were dirty black!)  I allocated three hours for this visit and was out by two!  When I got home, I had to retouch a lot of it.And my most recent experience was with the Ultra Stress Relaxation Treatment ($50).  It's a lighter ""massage that includes upper body, complete hand and arm, leg and foot massage.""  When I made the appointment, I specifically requested a female and they said sure.  When I go there, I was assigned to a male.  They were able to change that quite easily thank goodness.  They start you with a foot bath while you get your consultation.  I'm not sure if it's the Aveda way or my student's, but she started me facing upwards.  She had me flip twice - so I ended up facing upwards again.  A little too much flipping in my opinion.  One of the best things they do is end with this Peppermint Oil on your upper back that makes you feel lit.  Overall, the Aveda Institute is a hit or miss - just really depends on your student.  You have to be open to a little experimentation and have some free time on your hands.  The extra little bit of pampering they do does make it that much nicer.  I don't think I would go back for a manicure or pedicure, just doesn't seem like their specialty.Keep your eyes out - word is that they are going to be featured on Groupon again soon!  3.5 stars",5,2,NZkUyL5nb7Mh5Bc0y5547w,6/30/2011,4,0,25,Beauty & Spa

We always welcome a little healthy competition, even if Vegas does seem a bit over saturated with foot massage places.  We aren't always so anxious to make the drive to Spring Mountain to get some foot work done.The Husband noticed the sign driving on S. Rainbow and with only two yelp reviews, we were a bit hesitant.  We called ahead to find out the prices and to see if there was any availability.  They normally charge $38/hr, but with the Yelp discount - it's $34.  (They are currently offering a Yelp Deal too - $15 for $20 towards service, which I doubt you can combine.)We didn't make an appointment but were the only ones there last night.  Angel warmly greeted us and had us take a seat amongst the handful of chairs in the main room.  As she went to get us our tea, she hastily made a few calls getting her employees in as they had gone on an errand.  She told us about her business, gave us some information on Pure Foot & Spa and reflexology, and asked us what we thought of the interior decorating.  She had our feet soaking in the hot water while we waited, so we didn't mind.  It wasn't too long when one of the ladies returned.  She immediately got started on the Husband, so Angel started working on me while I waited for my guy to return.  As her delicate hands started working on my face, I was almost hoping my guy didn't return.  (There are some people that have gentle hands, and she's one of them.)  After a few minutes, my guy did arrive and he got started on me.Everything was pretty straightforward from them on - they work on your head, neck, and shoulders before heading to your feet and calves.  And after wiping down your feet, they flip you over so you get some back work.  One thing I really appreciate here is that they actually spend a good amount of time on your feet and calves.  Sometimes other places focus more on shoulders, but my feet and calves were what needed the attention and they got it.  Usually, I can tell the Husband is having a good experience when I hear him snoring.  This time, I didn't hear him snore at all, so I was concerned.  I was pleasantly surprised when he asked the name of his lady though because he obviously wanted to remember who she was.  Overall, we were both quite happy with our experience at Pure Foot and definitely glad to have them in the neighborhood.  We'll definitely be going back again!He had EVA and I had IVAN.* They charge $1 to use your credit card.  I recommend calling to make an appointment to be sure.

I've been waiting for the perfect day to use it since then.  Well, guess what? Today was that day!With my fiance out of town for the weekend, I took advantage of some much deserved ""Gabi time"" as I like to call my downtime.  I called a few days ago to make an appointment and I asked if there were any specials going on.  Lucky for me, there were several!  The one that was most appealing to me was the ""book any 60 or 90 minute treatment and get a complimentary 30 minute treatment to go with it.""  I chose to book a 60 minute aromatherapy facial and a 30 minute complimentary massage to go with it... I was in heaven!I'll back up a moment and just say that I've been to the Willow Stream Spa before... years ago.  Today was even more heavenly than I remembered.  I checked in around noon and didn't leave until after 6pm.  I could've stayed longer, but I had to come home to take Minnie out!The Willow Stream facility is gorgeous and includes every amenity you can imagine... I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.  So much so that I bought a couple on my way out.  After my services, I had lunch (a delicious salad with veggies and chicken) while I wrote some thank you notes and read my book... It was so peaceful.  It was like an escape from the world and I enjoyed every second of it!So, bottom line - if you are thinking about getting a spa-lover like me a gift anytime soon, Willow Stream Spa giftcards are always welcome... what an experience!

In the past six plus years since my initial review, I've been extremely loyal to The Root.  I've lost track of the number of times I've visited, and I've seen a handful of stylists but I cannot think of one time that I left the salon not feeling beautiful.  Five star experiences consistently... you don't find that very often!Since my last review, the salon also moved locations, just a tad bit south of their original location.  The new space is awesome.  It has a great, friendly vibe and it's super high tech.  Everyone that works there is friendly and easy to talk to... they really do live by the values on their website: relationships, creativity, fun, learning, humor, hard work, happiness and respect.I typically go in for a cut and standard color (ever since the greys started coming in), but I once got a pink streak in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, and I've gotten a brow wax and a make-up application at The Root as well.  They have plenty of services to offer... my husband has been in for both hair cuts and beard trims too!As mentioned above, I've been loyal to TRS, but I've seen a handful of stylists.  I trust anyone that Laurxc3xa9n hires, and I usually just book ahead with whom ever can accommodate my often busy schedule.  In addition to Laurxc3xa9n herself, I've seen Jillian and Dana, Desiree and Forest, and have been pleased every time.  Huge shout-out to Forest whom I saw most recently for the perfect color job and double french braid I requested at the last minute instead of a blow-out.  She is seriously a braiding expert.  It was perfect!I left the salon and headed to my kids' T-Ball game where I got a ton of compliments on my braids.  It then lasted through dinner, a night of sleep, and a hot yoga class the next day!  Thank you again, Forest!

I love the concept too... I never make the time to blow out my own hair, so it is a treat to go here and have it done for you.  I received a gift card for a blowout from this place ($35 value) when they first opened, and I finally made my way in to use it this past week...I made my appointment online on their website which was easy and I received a confirmation immediately.  (Gotta love technology when it works!)  I showed up a few minutes early and was greeted and welcomed in.  I was offered water to drink... I guess my pregnant belly gave it away that I wasn't going with anything stronger!  After looking at the style book, I chose to go with ""The Manhattan,"" a sleek and smooth style, and requested that Larysa, the girl assigned to do my blowout, use a round brush for slight curl underneath.  I also added on a ""floater,"" a 10-minute scalp massage ($10), which was awesome.  Half way through my session, Larysa wasn't feeling well, so someone else took over, but I know that was likely a fluke.  I enjoyed watching ""Julie and Julia"" during my time there... I guess they show girly movies all of the time which is a nice touch.  They also offer plenty of magazines and snacks.  (I went with a cranberry trail mix which was a perfect little afternoon bite).I was in and out within an hour and if it weren't for my gift card, it would've been just over $60 (including tip), which I think is a tad bit on the pricey side, but a huge treat nonetheless.  I was promptly emailed a thank you and receipt for my visit... another nice touch.  Bottom line: I think Drybar will be hugely successful in the Scottsdale Quarter location and I know they will continue to grow nationally as well.  I believe they are opening up in San Fran next.  I'll be back for a special occasion, I'm sure, but if anyone is looking to get me a gift, I'd gladly accept a giftcard to Drybar as well...

Since that last review, my life has changed quite a bit... I've gotten married and gone from a single membership to a family membership.  I have two kids, and in addition to using the gym for cardio, classes and swimming, I also take advantage of the Kids Club, the Cafe, a personal trainer, the spa, and most recently, we celebrated my 5 year old son's birthday at this club.One thing that has not changed is the five star rating... Here are some of the reasons why:-I'm greeted with a smile each and every visit... those friendly faces make a huge difference - especially when I'm coming in half asleep before 6am!-Roger Cahill.  If you're looking for a reliable and awesome personal trainer with plenty of knowledge and experience, great energy, creative workouts, etc... Roger rocks.  In 3+ years of training with him twice a week, I've had a different workout every single time.-Top notch yoga instructors: Beri, Heidi and Meghan are my favorites.  -Solid spin instructors as well... I don't get to spin as often as I like anymore, but if you want a kick-ass workout, just head to a class taught by Amanda, Miki, Patrice or Julie!-Massages from Charlie in the spa... I don't get these often enough!-Kids Club staff - my kids always have a good time in the kids club... and as mentioned above, I just had these folks host a birthday party for my son.  Nicole was incredible to work with and I must shout out to Laura, Isaac, and Gino for the hard work they did during the party too.  It was a blast and such a pleasure!-Cafe staff - These guys also helped out at the aforementioned party, but we order kids food here often and plenty of smoothies too.  I love the newer addition of the adult lounge and the service with a smile!-Locker Room amenities.  The locker rooms are kept clean, water pressure rocks, and all the amenities you need... I could go on and on, but I think you get the point by now.  If not, go experience this awesome place for yourself!  I'll see you there!",11,8,VU5QM89aFSk3Q02nzAERDw,8/31/2016,5,7,42,Beauty & Spa

Nail Spa at Lincoln View is now my go-to nail salon, and it has been for quite some time.  I started going here consistently for one reason: Lia!  Lia has been taking care of me for at least two years now.  I followed her to this salon and haven't looked back.  It is a bit on the pricier side, but it's worth it.  The owners, Jimmy and Demi are super friendly, and of course, Lia always takes amazing care of me whether I see her for a pedicure with acupressure/reflexology, a manicure, a wax, etc... She does facials too!  Lia has taken care of me through both of my pregnancies and she really knows her stuff.The salon is clean, the semi-private rooms are great, and they actually recently added on to have some additional rooms including a party room for small groups.  This salon offers their customers a bottle of water (nice touch), plenty of magazines to choose from, and pretty much any color of the rainbow when it comes to polish.I recently had my husband join me for a visit and since it was his birthday, I let him have the appointment with Lia and I had Annie do my nails... she did a great job also.  I had her do an accent nail on each hand, which was a fun twist for me.  They do take walk-ins, but I'd recommend making an appointment (especially if you'd like to request Lia).

Our one-night staycation at this renowned resort exceeded my expectations.We lucked out and stayed in one of the renovated casitas.  It had plenty of room all around; what a perfect layout!  (An extremely comfortable king bed, a desk, a sitting room, a fireplace, walk-in closet, flat screen TV, large bathroom and a patio with a gorgeous view).  In addition, they have every amenity one would expect and more.  High end spa products, robes, mini-bar, etc... plus extra special touches such as a flash light on a keychain for wandering the property at night, and a bedside book for your reading pleasure entitled ""Life is Good.""  Our casita # was 282 in case anyone wants to put in a special request ;)  It's located near the Golden Door Spa which I'll review separately but highly recommend!During the 24 hours we spent at The Boulders, we sat by the main pool, had some lunch, visited the spa, Jared played a bit of golf (I hear the course is pretty spectacular), saw a coyote, worked out in the top notch fitness center and movement studio, had a glorious breakfast at the Spa Cafe, and were blown away by the friendly staff / service all around.  The Boulders truly provides a Zen-like experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing get-away in a first class resort.  I will warn you, it's pricey in high season.  Thankfully, we did have a gift card this time... but I can't wait to return and take advantage of their summer rates (which I hear are pretty incredible).  Just like the book that sits bedside in the casita, staying at The Boulders really does remind you that ""life is good!""",18,10,#NAME?,4/25/2011,5,3,36,Beauty & Spa

So when my family went to Vegas to celebrate my brother and sister's birthdays, I knew we'd spend some time at the spa.  Even more exciting was that since we were staying at the Venetian, we were able to indulge at the Canyon Ranch Spa facility there... I admit, I'm spoiled.  I've been to Canyon Ranch in Tucson a handful of times and I really do consider it heaven on earth!  So there isn't much that would live up to the Tucson location, but the SpaClub at the Venetian comes close.  I worked out a couple of the days in their facility and even took a couple of classes - a body strength and a 'fit tease' - both were decent workouts and fun too!  Now that the workout is covered, on to the pampering... My mom, sister, and I all planned ahead and we each had a massage on one day and a facial the next.  Mom and Aubs had the signature Canyon Ranch massage and I decided to change it up and went with the Thai Yoga massage - all were phenomenal!  We were all invigorated after our services and we were each given a 'healthy living card' from our therapists on our way out... what a nice touch!  The facials the next day were pretty good too; Aubs and Mom loved theirs while I thought mine was just ok.

Next the facial began and she talked / educated me just enough so that I could relax and enjoy but learn a little something too... several scrubs, a partial pumpkin peel, a mask, exfoliation, and moisturizer later, I was given a choice: hands, feet, or neck and shoulders.

EXPERIENCE:1) We were warmly welcomed in by the staff and seated in leather recliners side-by-side each other.2) I received a cup of rose tea while Anna, my masseuse prepared the footbath.3) While my feet soaked in the footbath, I sat on the ottoman while she worked on my head, face, neck, shoulders, upper and lower back. It was by far the BEST non-oil massage I've ever had! Anna used trigger point therapy on my head, temples, and neck and I could feel the pent up stress just melt away. On my shoulders and back, she used a combo of acupressure and long strokes to knead away all the knots I had. I especially loved it when she used her entire forearm and went back and forth against each backbone...it felt so good, it made my EYES-ROLL-IN-BACK-OF-MY-HEAD!4) After 25 minutes, Anna dried off my feet, and had me sit back on the recliner and gave me a hand and arm massage which consisted of acupressure, kneading, and strokes. The hand massage was blissful and brought me back memories of my rave days!5) After 5 minutes, Anna went to the best part....the FOOT AND LEG MASSAGE! She put a balm on my feet and calves that felt a mixture of cream and shea butter. It was velvety smooth and intensified the effect of the massage even more. She started with trigger point therapy on certain parts of my feet, and then followed it with long strokes on the arch of my foot. I have many problems with the balls of my feet, so when Anna went to town on this part, it was Ahhhhhhhh, ORGASMIC!6) The last 2 minutes, ended with a thigh massage where Anna kneading my thigh with her fists. SERVICE:The staff at PF&S are very friendly, professional, and can speak conversational English (so there shouldn't be any awkward laguage barriers). Anna was very sweet and asked several times if I was ok and if the pressure was good. The pressure was perfect; it was gentle yet firm on the knots that needed to be worked out. PRICE:The decal outside the window stated $28 for 45 minutes, but we did the $38 for 1 hour. The staff at PF&S works hard, so please be mindful and tip accordingly. :)AMBIANCE:No frills establishment w/ a very simple and relaxing atmosphere. There are two flat LCDs on the Chinese CNN channel (muted) and Chinese classical music playing in the background. There are two rows of leather recliners; 10 total. We'll definitely be back on our next Vegas trip in 3 months! Vegas was a blast as usual and I definitely accomplished one of my goals: Happy Ending @ Vegas....CHECK! No pun intended of course...",31,20,oku3HsB2aq967SMqkPWD2A,3/10/2010,5,20,34,Beauty & Spa

I guess that's what I get for Waking Up In Vegas...As you can imagine, my debauchery from the previous night left me severely hungover so after getting a bite to eat at Grand Lux Cafxc3xa9, my friend suggested that we all go to Canyon Ranch Spa Club for some ""Steam Therapy"".  On Saturday, 2.19.11, we (party of six) came to CRSC at around 1 PM. There are two employees at the front desk. It took about 10 minutes to check-in and pay. There's a women, men and co-ed section in the spa. We stayed at the women's only section. FEE$40/day pass to use the gym and spa facilities. HOWEVER, it's only $20/person if your hotel room (Palazzo or The Venetian) is charged with a resort fee. If it's not, I highly recommend you paying the $17.95 one-time resort fee at the spa because it will cover everyone in your party. My friend paid the resort fee, so we ended up saving about $17/person. LOCKER ROOMYou will be provided a magnet key wristlet to access your locker. Your robe will be provided in your locker. TIP: BRING YOUR OWN SLIPPERS/FLIP FLOPS! TRUST ME!The pressure point slippers that's provided are the most UNCOMFOTABLE slippers ever! With each step, it felt like I was walking on pebble stone pavement. EVERYONE was complaining about how painful they were and that we were better off wearing out 5-inch stilettos from the previous night...no joke! I hated those slippers so much, I wanted to BURN mine after leaving!AQUAVANA THERMAL ENVIRONMENTSVarious aquathermal environments that are designed to help with muscle relaxation, increase oxygen flow and most importantly RID YOUR BODY OF TOXINS! The perfect ""morning after"" remedy after a night of copious drinking!ROOM #1: IGLOOExactly as the name says, it's basically a big freezer. My least favorite of all the rooms because of the cold temperature. ROOM #2: JACUZZ WITH HEATED LOUNGERSThe jacuzzi (bathing suit optional) could accommodate about 8-10 people. I LOVED the heated loungers (there were 6). They were made of some type of Styrofoam material that was firm yet soft. The loungers were so warm and comforting that I could have slept on it the whole day.ROOM #3: HERBAL  LACONIUM (WET STEAM ROOM) - HANGOVER CURE!!!!!If you're not use to humid heat, the Herbal Laconium room may be too much to handle in the beginning. HOWEVER, after several minutes, your body will adjust to the heat and it will become very bearable.  As I closed my eyes, breathed in deeply and exhaled, I could feel my body releasing all the tequila and goose through my pores and my pounding headache becoming fainter and fainter.  TIP: Drink plenty of water beforehand and pick up an iced towel (to cover your face) in the Jacuzzi room which will make it much easier to breathe in the steam room.  ROOM #4: Finnish Sauna (Dry Heat Room)Not a fan of dry heat rooms as I feel like I'm stuck in a charcoal bbq minus the charcoal. ROOM #5: Crystal Steam Room (Aromatherapy Steam Room)Saving the best for last! The aromatherapy steam room is less intense than the Herbal Laconium room and the fragrant floral scents will enhance your mood. THE QUIET ROOM/LOUNGEEnd your Aquavana Session at the quiet room where you can lay on plushy oversized sofas while reading trashy magazines and munching on fresh apples, bananas and oranges. It was so quiet and serene that I ended up taking a 10-minute power nap. I woke up refreshed with my pounding headache all gone!SHOWER/MAKEUP ROOM*10-15 private showers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash in each one*Personal sink area with lotions, deodorant, hair care products, hair dryer, combs, brushes, etc*If you need a curling iron or flat iron, you can get it at the front deskTIP: If you need a razer, shower cap, and/or towels, make sure to grab them before getting into the shower room. They're located near the entrance way to the showers.OVERALL LAYOUTThe CRSC is BIG and I didn't even know how big until I got lost and ended up on the men's side. It's confusing to say the least and it was like a maze to get out. If you suffer from ""Waking Up In Vegas"" syndrome like I always seem to, I highly recommend coming to the CRSC to get you out of your funk!",12,3,dPXJNnBIYeIETYy01Euvbg,2/28/2011,3,7,23,Beauty & Spa

I'm no stranger to pain and enjoy deep pressure massages, so Chinese foot massages/reflexology are right up my alley b/c done right, a  ""good"" pain releases all the pent up tension. So with most of the reviews boasting how awesome Good Foot Spa was, I decided to pay them a visit during my Vegas trip.My friend and I came to GFS on Friday, 7.30.10 at 4 PM. We had made an appt one day prior.There's a standard process for a Chinese foot massage/reflexology. First, you're brought warm tea and crackers. You feet is then soaked in plastic lined bucket of warm water while you're given a head, neck, shoulder and arm massage. Your masseuse then massages your calves and feet and finishes by flipping you over on the recliner and giving a back and butt massage. So, it's actually a full body massage (clothed) and the foot massage portion is about 1/3 of the massage time.Although the process at GFS was similar to other massage places, the overall feeling and results were NOT.I wasn't able to get my masseuse's name b/c she didn't speak English. When I asked her in Cantonese if she understood, she replied back, ""I speak 'Chinese' "". Uhhh, ok...1. Instead of getting a head massage, my masseuse placed lotion onto the palm of her hands and rubbed it into my scalp. She then repeatedly SCRAPED MY SCALP WITH HER NAILS for 20 minutes. Needless to say, I was cringing in pain the entire time. 2. The neck and shoulder massage was probably the highlight of the entire massage. It lasted for about 10 minutes and strong kneading was used to release the pent up tension.3. My masseuse then massaged my arms for 10 minutes, which I can't even call it a ""massage"". She didn't bother to put lotion on my arms which resulted in my skin stretching and pulling (aka Indian Burn) as she forcefully ran her thumbs up/down my forearm. 4. Afterwards, she gave me a foot massage, but mainly concentrated on my calves. What little she did to my feet did nothing to relieve my sore feet. She used her thumbs to rub up/down my arch several times and cracked my toes. When she massaged my ankle, she dug her thumbs into it, which made my flinch in pain. 5. Finally, she flipped me over and gave me a back massage. She ran her forearm along my spine back and forth. I like strong pressure and although she used a lot of force, something about it just didn't feel right. PRICE:$38 for 60 minutes. CC's accepted, but they appreciate tip in cash. Oh yah, btw, I mentioned Yelp for the 10% off and they had no clue what I was talking about. I tried to explain that I saw a promo on their Yelp page and they thought I was looking for a person named ""Yelp"". :XAMBIANCE/Dxc3x89COR:GFS is clean however, it's very dark inside. There are about 4-5 small cheesy pink painted rooms w/ about 3 recliners in each. For the novice, it may look a bit shady. However, as with most Chinese foot massages you're paying for their services and not the ambiance, so a bare boned dxc3xa9cor w/ mix matched walls, linens, and furnishings is typical. I think we were the only ones there at the time, so it was pretty quiet except for the occasional exchange btw my masseuse and my friend's masseuse. However, as an fyi, when these foot massages places do get busy, the environment is not serene. WHY I WILL NEVER RETURN:I've been to about 7-8 different foot massage places in SF, LA, and LV and this one is definitely on the bottom of my list. Why? 80% of the time, my massage was uncomfortable and painful. I know the difference btw ""good"" and ""bad"" pain and my pain was the latter. I left with an itchy scalp and oily hair. And, 2-3 days later my inner right ankle became sore and bruised and my arms were tender to the touch.Oh, Yelp...what happened??? *Sigh*We should have went to Pure Foot and Spa down the road instead...http://www.yelp.com/biz/pure-foot-and-spa-las-vegas#hrid:oku3HsB2aq967SMqkPWD2A",12,5,_zOaJ9zZ80Pm-nT4syn_6g,8/11/2010,2,6,11,Beauty & Spa

The architect of record is Albert Chase McArthur, who was once one of Wright's draftsmen and obviously he was heavily influenced by his employer and mentor. In fact, Wright consulted McArthur for a few months in the textile block construction which is one of the hotel's architectural trademarks. But let's get real. As talented as McArthur was, the owners knew Wright was the one with the marquee name and have played up the connection big time ever since its construction.To reinforce the same misconception I had, they added a signature Wright-designed stained glass in the lobby (photo: http://bit.ly/2wOrfC5) and the familiar Japanese-influenced stone sprites from Wright's Midway Gardens project in Chicago (photo: http://bit.ly/2fpJ7AJ), as well as naming the three onsite Restaurant after Wright, including one that celebrates the actual architect, Frank & Albert's - even though poor McArthur gets second billing (photo: http://bit.ly/2horLVx). Driving here at night from Camelback, I couldn't tell how close I was getting to the hotel until I saw a small sign at a creek crossing (photo: http://bit.ly/2xBj9kg).The entrance was designed in the familiar prairie style accented by intricately designed blocks (photo: http://bit.ly/2ylbQu6). The low ceiling of the expansive lobby is covered completely in gold leaf, and the lamps, rugs and couches are all typically Wright in their angular and orb-focused design (photo: http://bit.ly/2xoc6Mi). Strolling outside to the back terrace, I saw more sprites and sat on a Morris chair that served nicely as a lounge seat. The hotel has changed hands a number of times and is now part of the high-end Waldorf-Astoria collection. Hell, I didn't stay here but rates start at $265 per night for a standard guest room to around $800 for a villa. Well worth a stop and a stroll even if you're not a guest.",7,8,8PX_cHMJVi3-5y3vPY_aqA,9/23/2017,4,4,1,Beauty & Spa
