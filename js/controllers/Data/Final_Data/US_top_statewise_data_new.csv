A friend recommended Bullpen to me because they offer free UFC fights. I'm not a huge UFC connoisseur or anything but it's an excuse to get some friends together without spending $15 on a cover. You wouldn't have ever thought there was a UFC event on this particular night because it was not busy. This was an okay thing though because UFC fights tend to bring out the worst people in society. When you walk into this bar, it's spacious and feels nice. However, the hostesses or servers or whatever they are, are not near the front and you are left wandering around like a complete jackass. I literally had no idea where I was going. I would have sat at the bar and ordered a drink while I waited for my friend but it was full (Not blaming the bar for having a full bar, if anything kudos to them). But If you're solo and the bar is full, you are SOL. You will seat yourself in a massive booth, or sit alone in a deserted corner of the establishment. Besides the full bar, the rest of the place was empty. Most, if not all of the booths in the bar area appear to be made to seat parties of at least eight. Well, I definitely wasn't going to sit in a large booth even though that's where all the TVs were showing everything I wanted to watch.In an effort to try and comfortably find a place to sit and avoid the awkwardness, I had to walk over to all of the servers or hostesses or whatever they are who are at some podium on the way to the bathrooms. It felt like I was bothering them. Like another reviewer said, yes they appeared to be gossiping and goofing around rather than trying to help a patron who is obviously in some sort of distress. They're just like ""Yaaaaaahh, uh-huh-haha! Seat yourself!"" Alas, I sat myself on an uncomfortable metal thing away from civilization at a tiny round top table. Anyway, the bar area is pretty, and there are plenty of TVs of many different sizes. I actually really dig the vibe and look of the bar. By bar, I mean JUST the bar, not the establishment as a whole. But my friend and I felt alienated because unless you are sitting at the bar itself (all seats occupied by macho regulars) or have a huge party, you don't really have much of a spot in the bar area. We moved from the small, wobbly table to a bigger table that was a little more appropriate. Unfortunately, moving to this spot put us smack dab in front of the TV that has messed up color and only displays things in either pink or green. Whatever, we'll settle. Ok, ok, ok. Not everything was bad. Actually most of it wasn't bad. As I mentioned before, the UFC was free. That is awesome. The manager for that evening engaged in conversation with us multiple times throughout the night which was cool of him. He seemed like a genuine enough guy. Our server was very attentive but I'm not sure if this is because our server was a rock star, or because of how slow they were. For the sake of this establishment, I'll go with rock star. The brew was cold so no issues there. My wings, honey hot and diablo fuego were both great. My friend said the pulled pork sliders and fries were good, too. And this bus boy, man, this guy is like a HAWK! Before your glass hits the table after that final ever-so-refreshing gulp of your favorite lager, that thing is already in the dishwasher. Gotta love it!But seriously this place needs to get their seating in order and their whole server / hostess situation figured out. My attitude toward the place got started on the wrong foot. There needs to be an established podium up front that has at least one hostess there. Yes, even when you're slow. Also, just because your servers and hostesses have to dress like bimbos doesn't mean they actually have to act like them (airheads). This review isn't meant to slam your business it's meant to improve it. I'll be back and hopefully with a bigger group.",4,0,nQxJP_06Kg5ZCGiD1EzO3A,2/13/2017,3,2,36,Restaurant

Modern Margarita has a pretty nice atmosphere with a sweet patio. Good location. We decided to come here because Bourbon Jack's was too busy.The chips and salsa are tasty but do NOT make your customers pay for sides of salsa. I don't care what the flavors are, they don't warrant $4 per salsa. Whether you're a party of one or a party of four, you get one free salsa to go with your table's chips. We all know how fast that goes. This is awful for the customers and screams greed. If you're going to charge for every additional dish of salsa after the first, it should be per person in the party. For example, if there are six people in your party, your table is entitled to six sides of salsa before the charges are added on. But actually, scratch that idea. Just how about not charging for salsa at all?My friend and I ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer. They were super good! We agreed it was the best part of the meal. We looked under the ""entree section"" of the menu and noticed the only two items there are a burger and a hot dog. So, our eyes wandered to the taco section, which apparently aren't bold enough to be entrees in their own right. I ordered the carne asada tacos meal, which was $16. They've won awards for those exact tacos, and I don't know how. It sucked. The meat was tough and flavorless. My friend said the same about the tacos he ordered which I think was pork. The rice just tasted bad. I guess the beans were okay.The waitress took her time, but it wasn't bad enough that it warranted leaving anything below 15%. We're friends with some bands that play at Bourbon Jack's across the street, so, after our meal we headed back over. Upon arriving, they asked where we had gone since we didn't eat at Bourbon's. I said ""Modern Margarita."" They said ""Oh, nice! How was it?"" I said ""Well, they charge for salsa!"" And that pretty much killed it for everyone. We're in our mid to late twenties and whenever we eat out for Mexican, you better believe that salsa gets destroyed. A group of four of us could easily eat seven or eight of those salsa dishes. That would be around $30 in salsa. There is no way we're paying that. Just make it free and you might keep a table of four around long enough to spend well over $100 in drinks. The salsa is good but isn't good enough to charge for.Free chips and salsa are a staple of solid Mexican joints. The servers know this, otherwise they wouldn't cringe when informing their table's of this charge. Considering they have other locations I doubt they'll make a change. But if they do we might come back.",13,2,KoQRE36uTe4s6UbrpBHbOQ,9/7/2016,2,2,23,Restaurant

So off I went in search of Tram's.Tram's is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!It was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.I ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as ""Pho Hanoi"") with garden rolls and a glass of water.I suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.Now I'm guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I'm mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren't doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!I added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.I then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!I added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end.

The soup was rather average. It sounded better than it actually was. I ended up adding a good bit of black pepper and hot sauce to make the soup interesting.Spinach Salad: Consisted of course of Spinach, Benton's Lardons, Shaved Fennel, Mustard Vinaigrette, and Manchebo cheese. The Spinach salad was very tasty, the crunchy bacon (Lardons) on the salad really elevated it.Breakfast #1:Went with the buffet and had them make me a custom omelette: Spinach, mushrooms, onions, and two kinds of cheese. Plus some bacon and smoked salmon on the side. I added some chopped red onions and capers on the smoked salmon. The omelette was really good. Also had a glass of V-8 juice, coffee, and water. Coffee was strong and good.Dinner #2:Had dinner in room. Ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese (Marscapone, Chive, Parmesan Crisp), an order of the Hand Cut Salt Salt Fries (served with a Malt Vinegar Aioli), and the Natural Free Range Chicken Wings (ordered extra crispy) (served with Buffalo Sauce, Celery Leaves, and Pickled Carrots).The Truffle Mac & Cheese was very creamy and oh so good! I did add some black pepper and some hot sauce to it - as that is how I roll. The fries were hot and crispy, and the wings were cooked extra crispy as I requested.Breakfast #2:Again - went with the buffet and had them make me another custom omelette: Spinach, mushrooms, onions, and fresh jalapexc3xb1os. They pulled out some pickled jalapexc3xb1os - which are not very good in an omelette. So they went and got some fresh ones to add - and two kinds of cheese. Plus some bacon and biscuits and sausage gravy on the side.Omelette was awesome, bacon was tasty.

There were a couple more plates in addition to the one in the picture.The food was fresh, tasty and delicious. Some places commit the sin of over-salting their Edamame - fortunately, they got the salt level just right. And the Miso soup was delicious. All of the various sushi rolls, Nigiri sashimi, and such was scrumptious!They also offer a couple of Ale selections from Great Lakes Brewing Co., a local craft brewery. So I had the opportunity to sample a pint of the Great Lakes Brewing Co. Christmas Ale. Best description I can offer - it seemed like a cross between a Pale Ale and a spiced Ockoberfest. It was very good and I would order it again.The service was very good - at least from the food server perspective. The ambiance of the place is interesting - with zillions of little festive red and green lights slowly bouncing and twinkling around there room.I can't give Dragonfly Lounge 5 stars for one reason. When we arrived, they offered to take our coats and put them in a locked room. Well, when it was time for us to depart, it turns out the guy who locked our coats away - left the restaurant for the evening - AND took the keys to the room where our coats were locked away. So now we are standing around waiting. The restaurant calls the guy and we wait about 10 minutes - for him to return and unlock the room. It's late at this point - close to 11:00 pm, so we are all a bit surprised about this turn of events. When the guy returned - after 12 minutes, he had an angry, surly look on his face.

My reaction? Hell yes - let's do this!So I waited my four minutes - was worth the wait too.

I asked for tomato juice, but they don't offer that as an option.The execution on the Omelet was lacking - the bell pepper consisted of huge strips and chunks of bell pepper - some dicing would have made them sautxc3xa9 up or cook through more evenly. As it was, much of the bell pepper was close to raw. The spinach taste and texture makes me think they thawed out a bag of frozen spinach from the store and just threw a wad of it in the omelet - the vegetables would have tasted a lot better had they first been sautxc3xa9ed before throwing them into the Omelet.The hash browns that were served with the Omelet were disgusting.

Oddly, the water is served in Mason jars. Since that's retro chic I was surprised, as there's nothing chic about this place. Some burgers come stabbed with a steak knife to hold them together.  Another surprise was the hostess lady - she walks around in cowboy chaps which isn't that big a deal, but she only wore a pair of modest black knickers underneath, like a bikini bottom. You can't help but stare! This was probably the oddest addition to this potentially wholesome restaurant - a cheeky bit of Vegas twist I guess.

I am not a huge fan of breakfast places, but he loves them.I was pleasantly surprised! The menu was actually a bit more interesting than the standard bacon, grease, eggs, grease, pancakes, grease . . . and grease, which is a snapshot of what breakfast venues typically offer.I took a chance on the Tractor Driver Combo with Griddled French toast, which is basically a thick french toast with pecans and banana, and some sort of cinnamon cream sauce. Can you say delectable? Since it was a combo, it also came with bacon and eggs. Initially, I was put off by the prices, but once the food came, the cost was justifiable. Two people could share a plate, easily. L'il skinny women who don't eat like me and my midwest-farm-girl sisters might even be able to share it between three people. My beefy man and typically ravenous teen did not come close to finishing; I think I did better than both of them.My knee-jerk reaction was to give this place a 4, but since I am not impressed by breakfast joints and this one was impressive, I'll compare apples to apples (pancakes to pancakes?) and give it a solid 5.So, yeah . . .

I tasted it and could tell it was frozen.  I only tried to get the server attention about 9 times and she just focused elsewhere.  Finally she noticed me 10 minutes later.  I said I can tell this is frozen from a box to the fryer.  She said,  ""yeah."" I said I always came here for this dish and it was the best anywere!  Are there new owners or a change of cooks.  She said the restaurant was bought by new owners.  I  told her I don't come to a restaurant to eat frozen food.  I  could buy that frozen in a store for $2.99.  I  wouldn't because I can make it homemade. how hard is it to pound out roundsteak dredge in seasoned flour and egg and fry it?  Not very, especially for a restaurant.  It really bothers me when a Restaurant put out sh*t instead of making the best food they can.  LAZINESS and lack of committed to quality.  And more so a lack of respect for their diners to give them frozen crap and expect them not to notice.  I left.

We wanted steak, but didn't necessarily want to spend an arm and a leg. Well, we succeeded at the former, if not the latter, but we left very happy and very, very full.We settled into the bar and I asked the bartender about the dry-iced martini. It was at that point I discovered the bar was much more about the fufu martinis rather than classic. I'm partial to the classics, so I was a bit disappointed. That said, that's E-Me - I should have checked out the menu in advance, or read a couple more Yelp reviews. (Take note if you're looking for a classic cocktail here, you won't find it.) I wound up going with the on the menu manhattan, which was very good, but not great.Now it was time to settle into the real reason for going - meat. We had a bit of a conversation with the very friendly bartender about what was good and must-haves on the menu. We already knew we were having the bone marrow, which she did recommend. We talked steak and sides, when she insisted we have the brussel sprouts. Now, I'm not much of a brussel sprout fan, but given the recommendation that was given I figured we had to have them.The bone marrow came out and it was two huge bones. I could have slid down them - I'd have been a very happy man if I had. The marrow was plentiful and delicious. You won't have to scrape just to get a little, you'll be scraping just to get the last little bit of all that wonderful marrow goodness.Now for the steak. I did the bone-in ribeye, which came out perfectly rare - if not maybe a touch too rare, which is very weird for me to say. That said, it was amazingly flavorful and near melt-in-your-mouth. And the brussel sprouts - well, I'm not a true convert yet, but if you keep serving me more like these I might change my ways.Then, on to dessert. A huge, and delicious, butter cake. We couldn't stop eating it despite the fact that we were absolutely stuffed.In the end, and for the money, I do think there are better steak experiences to be had on the strip.

This place has earned that right.While there may be many places in Vegas you can get ""prime rib"" for $10, I can guarantee you the quality and service doesn't hold a candle to a dinner at Lawry's.The first thing that strikes you when you walk in is the feel of the place. It looks like it was transported in from the 1940's. We arrived very early for our reservation hoping to be seated earlier, alas to no avail. However, we were directed to the lounge area to enjoy a predinner cocktail. (Bonus points to anyone who can guess what I ordered.)Upon being seated we were introduced to our server, Ms. Backman. Not Susan, or Stephanie, or Alice. Her name was Ms. Backman. Ms. Backman introduced us to the menu and let us know we could choose our cut of prime rib when the carver wheeled the roaster around to our table. We started off with some shrimp cocktail which was good. The one issue I did have with it was the cocktail sauce didn't have enough horseradish, ironically enough.After finishing our appetizer, Ms. Backman came back to prepare our spinning salad and deliver our wine (bottle of J Lohr cab). Shortly after the salads Ms. Backman came back to introduce us to Juan, our carver. He opened up the roaster to present us with a three skewers of meat, mashed potatoes and other sides if you were interested. We both went with the The ""Diamond Jim Brady"" Cut, which includes the bone. It was served with mashed potatoes and doused with au jus, with horseradish (creamed and straight) on the side. The meat was unbelievably flavorful and tender. It certainly didn't need any horseradish, but as I love horseradish I couldn't resist. The mashed potatoes were of course perfect (you have to work hard to mess up mashed potatoes), and the gravy awesome.Trust me - resist the urge to visit a $10 buffet to get your prime rib.

Will I go back? No. But that's mostly because this place isn't for me. This is a place for someone looking to drop some serious coin on a very good (maybe even great) dinner before heading out to the club. Being as I haven't been to a club in this millennium, and driving house music isn't my bag, I won't be back. That's not to say that this is a bad restaurant - it's just not for me.Now, as for the review.Well - the only way for me to review this place is to tell a quick story. My wife and I stopped by looking for a nice dinner before heading out for a show. We were suited/dressed up, and quickly realized we were well overdressed, despite what the prices on the menu would seem to hint in regards to dress.We were seated at a booth/table combo with the booth facing out to the restaurant and the chair facing the wall. I, being the gentlemen (on occasion, really), let my wife have the view of the restaurant while I chose the view of her. And that was the defining decision of the night.Unbeknownst to us at the time we were seated next to the rejected cast of the Jersey Shore. Or at the very least the mother/daughter combo. Thick Jersey accent, drunk, and full of drama. The daughter went on for a good 15 minutes about how awesome it was that I let my wife have the view of the restaurant and what a gentleman I was. The mother didn't say much - I'm assuming she was simply too drunk to communicate. The daughter was interrupted by the brother coming in (for apparently the third time) to start an argument with the mother/daughter about the fact that they needed to leave and he was tired of waiting. He came back once more during dinner to do the same. And having to watch them eat (they were seated right next to us, so you couldn't avoid it) was both comical and disgusting at the same time.Fortunately they left before our appetizers arrived. The waitstaff, who really should have thrown them out, made it up to my wife and I with champagne. Fortunately, I'm a man that can be plied with free alcohol. The little adventure gave us a great rapport with the waitstaff. They took great care of us for the remainder of the night.As for the food, we started with the foie gras French toast and the shrimp ""rice krispy treat"", which was really a bisque with toasted rice. The bisque was fantastic with just a bit of a spice to it. The foie gras French toast was very good, but the bread was a bit thick, which overpowered the foie gras.For dinner my wife went for the filet (peppercorn crusted), and I did the ribeye with the same preparation. We both went rare. The filet was perfectly done. The ribeye, well, it was bordering on medium. When the server came back over to ask how everything was, the fact that I didn't immediately say ""it's great!"" let her know something was wrong. She immediately scooped up the plate, apologized, and had the kitchen fire a new one. The second one came out cooked perfectly. In fact, when they came out with the second steak they brought out a new thing of potatoes, which was our side. I give them full props for fixing the mistake instantly.As I mentioned at the beginning, I don't think I'll go back. That has more to do with the music/atmosphere than with the Jersey Shore rejects. If you're looking for a club dinner before a club outing, stop by. If you're looking for a reserved steak dinner, this is absolutely *not* the place to go.",0,0,ArqeHZsww6I8O4uawpJ4LA,12/5/2012,4,2,21,Restaurant

And, as an added bonus, we got to control the lighting and music volume in the room (I really don't like the music they play there, but it's easy enough to tune out.)The service we received was absolutely impeccable.

We did an appetizer course of our own mix and match - just ordering a bunch of stuff off the menu, including the above mentioned duck foie gras ravioli so everyone could have a taste.

Rouses Point is short drive from St.Albans but long enough that I haven't been here since I was little. After reading the reviews for the places to eat in town, we settle on Gino's. We arrive to a almost full parking lot. We head inside to place our order, a large pizza and a order of poutine. 30 minute wait. That is fine and we head out to continue our drive, 15 minutes down the road (it was beautiful!) and 15 back. Foods still not ready and we are told 10 more minutes. We get back in the car head back over the bridge and get drinks, head back to wait. I take a spot outside with the maybe 10 folks chilling with a few dogs and some kids. It's a nice picnic area, very clean and well cared for.   Our pizza and poutine comes out it looks delicious! Being so close to the border I had my fingers crossed for some authentic cheese curd poutine, I was a little disappointed that they used mozzarella shredded cheese. I have discovered that it's really rare to come across real cheese curd poutine. The crust for the pizza was ""meh"" and the cheese wouldn't stay on the crust. My boyfriend informed me this was because they use a ""circular method"" for applying cheese. They add a lot in the middle of the pie and then work outwards using less cheese and not work it up to the crust when the sauce isn't. The cheese would stay on much better with even distribution up to the part of crust that has no sauce. I got a black cherry creemee. I asked for it to have a vanilla/black cherry swirl but that didn't happen. Sadness. My boyfriend got a root beer float, nothing special about it. He said ""It was a float."" The cashier seemed slightly agitated and I wouldn't have been surprised if I saw her roll her eyes, but she remained polite and was fairly formal. The girl at the creemee stand didn't have any personality and was just meh. The boy that was cleaning the picnic tables didn't speak much, but was nice when I was throwing out our plates and I asked if they had recycling inside for a bottle, he gladly brought that inside for me.",0,0,couIyeOUFaC7wKCPMDifsA,7/20/2014,3,0,16,Restaurant

We love izakaya and frequently go to Village Yokocho in NYC so we wanted to see how this place would hold up.We went there on a Saturday and got there about 7ish or so, it was pretty packed and there was a large asian clientele which I always look at as a good thing in an asian establishment. We had to wait for about 5 mins or so, but with a smaller party it's always a shorter wait and we had a seat at the bar.The waitresses there were adorable and were very friendly and helpful. You got a regular menu but as people said in other reviews you have to walk around to see what other tasty treats might be posted on the wall around the restaurant.There were a few things we had to get, one was the yellowtail tartare. It was...interesting, with tortillas and avocado being the main tastes, I am not sure if I would get it again but it wasn't bad...I wish I got more of a taste of the yellowtail in the dish. A quick breadown of the other thins we got if my memory serves correct:1) Wasabi octopus - seemed like a popular dish, very fresh, cut good so its not to chewy, cheap2) Fried squid - great sauce, perfectly cooked3) Red snapper carpaccio - pretty presentation, eh on taste but not terrible4) Spicy deep fried chicken - another seeminly popular dish, it was drenched in that srirachi sauce (sp?) but the breading wasn't to heavy and reminded me of a tempura5) Tried to get salmon belly but it was sold out for the night6) Honey toast of course - I dont know how they get half a loaf of bread to do that but I love carbs and I liked the denser chewy parts that were drenched in honey that you scoop up some melting ice cream with. We had to get some Asahi Super Dry which was super cheap for the super big bottle, all together I dont even think our bill came up to $40 with all of that between the two of us, and it was an interesting neighborhood. The ladies next to us got a bunch of sushi and a ramen dish which looked good but nothing to spectacular. I wish I saw or thought to ask for monkfish liver because that is really really yummy. We wanted to get some yakitori but they didn't have any combos and the selection was pretty small, overall I think our NY spot is still #1 but this place was solid.One thing I dont like about Vegas is it's a little hard to get a cab and you technically can't flag one down on the street, you can call for one and there is a cab stand close by...we happened to see a guy leaving the shopping complex next door and ran up on him to get a ride, which can work as well.",0,0,pE0fTtMM62sN_j2kivhN3w,3/7/2010,4,0,56,Restaurant

The service was excellent again, our server was still in training but he did mention where the caviar was this time so that's good that they are doing that now. They prepared the lobster different this time, it was the entire tail steamed I think, and I felt it was better my bf thought it was just as good. A few of the other dishes that we enjoyed which may or may not change was the lobster papparadelle, giant cocktail shrimp, trout, peppered salmon and lox, salmon en croute, sushi wasn't bad and they had standard selection, sake was excellent...the brand is Nagasaki (clever). Raw oysters I didnt care for to much this time and they didnt have raw clams, the caviar was still ok but I am still not a caviar expert.

I'm not sure since when, but they're here in full effect at Herbs & Rye. The elixirs you'll find coming across this bar are seriously top notch and could stand their ground against any in my favorite coastal cities such as Portland, Seattle, SF and the like. I'm so glad  to have found this spot (thanks to all who recommended it and to Misti for taking me there) and it will definitely be on my itinerary for any return trip.This is the lest ""Vegas"" bar in Vegas,  and that's one of the big reasons I am drawn to it. No flashy BS, no gaming, no smoking, no crazy-extreme high prices on the drinks, and almost zero pretense. Nice guys making stellar drinks in a chill, subdued setting (at least when I was in there) that's free of all the glam and glitz that exists a few blocks away. Nothing against that stuff (my stop prior to this was for a delicious cocktail at the fancy Vesper Bar) but I sure do love me good cocktails minus the snoot. The cocktails on the list are all classics, organized by the decade that gave birth to them. The list is medium-length but very carefully curated, and I found no less than three of my favorite elixers jumping off the pages and into my glass. The two drinks I sampled were a Vieux Carre (a personal fave) and a Remember The Maine (also a fave). Both were impeccable - perfectly balanced with a nice depth of flavor. High quality ingredients and trained hands sure do make some fine drinks. The story behind the guy who owns the place is a cool one too. He started out at the bottom and made is way up to the top - self taught. I respect that. And his humility and charm is something often not seen amongst the highest level of mixologists. He's a true barman. The food menu is hearty and tasty. I only sampled the truffled mac side fior $7 (a hearty portion) and it fit the bill. For a respite from overpriced drinks and chaos of the strip, get thee to Herbs & Rye. You'll make up your $$ on cab fare after only a couple of drinks and you'll be so glad you did.",8,7,NuvlsWyUl9P-VHuTHAg7gA,10/21/2011,5,3,49,Restaurant

It's not like most Indian places I'm used to. A little more upscale, a little more gourmet, a little more... well... different. My paradigm for Indian food is, in general, that the best food comes from the dingiest places - so a proportionally inverse relationship between the fanciness of the decor and the quality of the food (from the standpoint of taste). When I walked in to Mint I immediately formed an impression about what I was going to eat, and I was not too surprised in the end. Just glad to have some decent Indian food since I come from a place that has none. The food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats, obviously more hand-made sauces, etc. Not as dirty, earthy, pungent, and 'street' as the style that really rocks my socks. But it's good nonetheless, and sticks fairly well to form as being actual Indian and not fusion, which is what I tend to see at higher-end Indian places. I sampled the chicken Vindaloo, which at a half order contained a surprising amount of tender, succulent chicken but not the same amount of potatoes that I'm used to. It has a decent heat to it but not quite the ""fiery descent"" that's comically described on the menu. The Saag Paneer is quite nice, with a less 'spinach-y' flavor than I'm used to. A much more subtle and balanced version of the heady green beast. The name of our third curry escapes me - a blond affair with veggies. Nice and creamy and delicious - probably my favorite of the three. Paired up with a bowl of basmati rice and a basket of Roti, 3 half-sized (8oz) dishes makes for a beyond-filling meal for two. Props for offering half-size portions... if only the price were half too!The drinks list is mighty impressive, with a very extensive beer selection, some fun cocktails including a whole spate of flavored lassi offerings, and of course wine. My rose vodka lassi was interesting (tasted like rose!) and the mango rum is exactly what you'd expect. Three half-plates, Roti and two lassi cocktails came to a sum total of $54, kind of a lot for the amount of food, but definitely a higher quality of ingredients than I'm used to seeing in the street Indian I usually seek out. The experience, including the impeccable service, also adds in to the value. Papadam to start, clean plates to transition from papadam to meal, and constantly full waters. This is probably the largest departure from the dirty hole in the wall spots I hit in SF for my sub-continent fix. I'd definitely come back after spending some more time exploring Indian options in LV.",7,3,Z5-cveBlY9RGTJdXWKkxeA,10/19/2011,4,4,43,Restaurant

We arrived for an early seating, at 7 PM promptly, and were seated at a wonderful table on the patio so we could admire the water show starting at 8:30 PM.   While I had originally hoped for a meat dish like lamb, I veered course instead and went for a seafood dinner, starting with a lobster bisque and following it up with moules frites, a generous portion of mussels and a side of wonderfully prepared french fries.   Overall, I thought the meal was good, not great.   The service, however, was absolutely stellar.My lobster bisque wasn't quite what I expected.   The presentation was perfect and there were generous pieces of lobster bathing in the watery broth.   Yes, you read right...  While the menu described it as bisque, I found that the soup was much too watery for my sophisticated palate.  This course left me longing for a creamy and silky texture which I simply did not find.   The lobster, too, was a bit rubbery for my taste.  My wife tasted it and agreed with me that she'd had better lobster.    I did have the privilege of tasting her torchon de foie gras, which was very good although it was served slightly too cold.   It was very good and solid, but it didn't quite meet the expectations I had.   Let's just say that if you know the Foie at Bouchon in Yountville, then you've tasted better Foie Gras.Once again, I thought presentation and service was perfect.  We got plenty of attention from the waiter and my water and wine glasses were refilled promptly.   All in all the service here was 5 stars.   The mussels and fries, though, were closer to 3 stars.   Again, it's easy for me to critique them having just had the same dish a week early at Bistro Jeanty in Yountville.  Here too, Chef Jeanty trumps Daniel Boulud.   When the menu description evoked a dish of mussels served in a thick aromatic broth, I found that the dish was instead served with plenty of greens on top but very little creamy goodness.   Perhaps it's merely Boulud's attempt to serve clean and healthy food to a discriminating Wynn crowd.   Still, I was hoping the French Chef's Brasserie would have indeed thrown heavier and more cholesterol-laden creamy goodness my way.Would I come back?  Most certainly.  The food was very good and with my newly adjusted expectations, I would not be disappointed next time.   Still, this place in no match for Picasso at the Bellagio.

We then proceeded to share a Kobe beef Rib Eye and some scallops.   For sides, we got the Mac & Cheese, the spinach souffle, and the trio of mashed potatoes.Let's just say that I was fondling the Mac & Cheese, drooling, while looking at my wife in very suggestive ways.   She got embarassed and I just got off...  No, really.  The Mac & Cheese totally rocks.   The richness of the cheese is cut with the acidity of the truffle oil, and the result is a masterpiece.  Bravo!The kobe steak was pretty good, though not great.   The scallops, though, were absolutely tender and beautifully prepared.    The mashed potatoes, too, were beautifully prepared.    The spinach souffle, while nicely presented, didn't leave a lasting memory.   Still, it tasted good enough that it deserves a honorable mention.The sommelier was also absolutely stunning.   We ordered a bottle of Paraduxx Zinfandel.   They were out, and the sommelier recommended a bottle by B Cellars instead, slightly cheaper.   Well, it was a stellar wine, and it was nice that we didn't feel like he tried to upsell us.   Absolutely stunning.A wonderful experience.

We were staying on East Harmond near the newly remodeled Planet Hollywood.   The plan was to drive to the Mirage, grab a parking spot and go see a show there, and then drive to the Bellagio for dinner.  We had reservations at 9:30 PM.   No problemo, right?Well, driving in Las Vegas is hella stressful, and even more stressful for my stepfather, who drives rather seldom....   Basically this whole drive (or ride, in my case)  was somewhat akin to playing Russian roulette with a dirty ol' Russian gun that misfires one out of every three shots.   Best bet, you may not permanently blow your head off but you'll blow a hole through your head large enough that you'lll retain more than a slight speech impediment....   Yeah, just lovely....Anyway, so we eventually made it to Sensi at 9:40, some 10 minutes after our reservations.   They couldn't seat us then & there, but they said it'd be about 20-30 minutes..... Fine, I thought, I'll order a stiff martini to calm the nerves after this brutal drive we just had... and we'll eventually be seated.  The bartender was slow and full of attitude, preferring to stare at the cute playboy bunnies who were looking at him lovingly instead of making my fucking martini.   Can't say I blame him, other than the fact that I wanted some liquid medicine... AND FAST!!!We were eventually seated some 30 minutes later... We ordered 3 oyster shooters for appetizer and, as main course:  1 Roasted Salmon, 1 New York Steak, 1 Day Boat Scallop, and 1 Lamb Chop...   We ordered 2 side dishes alongside that:  mashed potatoes and deep fried asparagus.As far as drinking was concerned, I wanted to order a nice bottle without freaking everybody out, so I ordered wine # 14437, which, as it turns out, was the Brunello Altesino and it was ripe to perfection... An absolutely perfect wine pairing.Food was way good, portions were generous, and the wine definitely complemented the food very well.   I ate the lamb chop and really enjoyed it.  The meat was so tender and fell right off the bone.   I tasted my wife's scallops and man-oh-man were they awesome too!  Served with a puree of English peas, it was a delightful dish.   My stepfather seemed to enjoy his steak, and my mother definitely enjoyed her salmon.Service was wonderful... Shortly after we started our dinner, the sommelier came to let us know we had ordered the last bottle of 14437 but made several other recommendations.   Frankly, we had no intent to dig into another bottle, seeing as the first one was already $121, but still, it was very professional of him to come and let us know.  Our waitress was fabulous...Decor, very modern and trendy and, thankfully, not too loud.  All in all a wonderful dining experience and Sensi goes into my top 20 in America fo' sho'",2,2,TPOWp4w4JQJchAZDI9ZbTg,6/7/2007,5,1,37,Restaurant

While it may not have been the culinary apogee (that distinction actually goes to Picasso which is of course Julian Serrano's other restaurant located in the Bellagio), the food here was nevertheless absolutely amazing and the service was absolutely the best I've had in Las Vegas.   While it was my Birthday lunch which might cloud my vision a little, our waiter and the whole staff truly made my meal here one I shall remember fondly until the end of my days.My wife and I walked in last Friday at around noon.   While we had no reservation, the staff greeted us kindly nevertheless and sat us near a TV, as I was following the Villanova - George Mason NCAA basketball game.  Our waiter approached us immediately and suggested we try the sangria.  It being my Birthday, I happily obliged him and I had in fact 3 of them by the time the meal was done.   Let me tell you right now the drink was crisp and very tasty and left absolutely no headache later on (something Sangria is typically notorious for in that regard)As far as food is concerned, we started out with the Spanish Charcuterie Platter, Fried Calamari, White Ceviche and Crispy Pancetta Iberica.   Of those 4 dishes, the Fried Calamari came out on top, followed by the White Ceviche.   The Charcuterie platter was delightful too, while I must say we were not blown away by the Pork Belly (Pancetta) dish.We followed up these dishes with 3 more tapas:  Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, the spanish chicken croquetas, and the Flat Iron Steak.   The first 2 were absolutely divine.   The third one was just so-so.By that point, both my wife and I were absolutely stuffed.   Still, the waiter would not relent on us getting dessert, especially after he heard my wife was a Pastry Chef and it was my Birthday.   We nevertheless declined dessert, being completely full at that point.   Still, the waiter brought us a Crema Catalana on the house.   Since the dish was there, we had to eat it and indeed it was one of the best Creme Brulees (my wife's expected, of course) that I've ever had.   The dessert is served with a pineapple sorbet which is so clean and beautiful that it tastes like you are biting into an icy wedge of Hawaiian Pineapple.Simply amazing dining experience.   The moment we were out of the restaurant, I tweeted to all the people who were attending the same conference I was that if they had no dinner plans, they should absolutely check out Julian Serrano.   I don't know if they took my advice, but this is a great restaurant and I plan on coming back here many times!",1,0,s0-WJ8UPAN6cm6O8K-jLkw,3/21/2011,5,0,27,Restaurant

I've visited their La Jolla, Woodland Hills, and Walnut Creek locations (all in California) numerous times and have always had a wonderful experience.   When I saw that there was a Fleming's right across from my hotel, I made sure to dine here at the first opportunity.Being by myself, I opted to sit at the bar and started off with a Fleming's Classic Martini.   I sipped merrily on my cocktail while perusing their menu and honed in pretty quickly on the lamb chops and their Chipotle Mac & Cheese.The food arrived actually right as I took my last sip of martini.   Having ordered a beautiful meal, I figured I'd accompany it with a nice glass of red wine and I ordered a glass of Hall Cabernet at 18 dollars  (I know, ouch!)   Here's where they lost that 5th star:  they brought me a carafe and poured me the glass of red wine but I never actually got to see the bottle of Hall.    Now that's not saying that they totally gave me some cheap red wine instead of what I ordered.   While my palate isn't so sophisticated I certainly am able to tell the difference between swill and more elegant vintages.   Nevertheless, if I'm going to venture out and blow almost 20 bucks for a *glass* of wine, show me the bottle, will ya?The meal was lovely and the wine paired well with the lamb and Mac & Cheese.   I stuffed my face, royally and had a wonderful meal.   Most certainly I would come back in a heartbeat.    I actually had to laugh at some point when I looked down the bar and realized I was the only person there drinking wine.   Everybody had a glass of bourbon, or some martini or other, and that includes the few people that, like me, had opted to dine at the bar.     What's the dead giveaway that there's a Northern California in your restaurant, I chuckled to myself?   Look for the guy who's sitting at the bar, eating lamb chops and drinking a glass of red wine.    Classic!",1,1,PYW3JWgb4y2vJuZAAbG4zA,7/15/2010,4,1,19,Restaurant

They are good - but you must be willing to wait.I have not yet tried the hot entrees.I am truly thankful that our office has a cafeteria, so I dare not complain too much.  It is open for breakfast and lunch Monday thru Friday.  They close from 10:30 - 11:30 for a while between breakfast and lunch. It shuts down completely  at 2:30 PM.It's great to come here when the weather is bad, rain or snow - but again - be prepared for a long wait for mediocre cafeteria grub.Service is slow. but friendly.  they could use more cashiers and sandwich makers during peak lunch times.

The wine tower is cool and I loved the handy electronic wine menu (an HP Tablet).  I could have played with that all day but then... I'm a wine dork.  Service was helpful, if a little pretentious...   they did get us out in time to catch our show, though, which was appreciated.  The sommelier we had (a vivacious blonde woman) seemed to enjoy her job and was helpful ... not snotty at all.    I liked her.They have a three course and a seven course menu.  We had the three course with a Champagne cocktail to start (I had the Champagne Negroni) which were quite good, even if they were totally overpriced at $21 a glass.  Unfortunately, the food was not up to par.   I had the Scallop Trio appetizer.  The scallop wonton was good but nothing special,  the truffle encrusted scallop was not at all encrusted... just a seared scallop sitting in a mysterious bland sauce... I tasted no truffle at all.   Finally, the ceviche spring roll was covered in some sort of creamy green sauce that didn't taste like much of anything.  Not spicy, not sweet, not savory.. just kind of nothingness.  Disappointing.   I would have liked the two hot items to have actually been hot, as well.  Meh.My friends Black Mission Fig and Roquefort Tart w/Serrano Ham was good.  I love that kind of combination of sweet, salty and rich.   However, I felt like it too could have been warmer.   For my main, I had the Organic Roast Chicken with Fricassee of Fingerling Potato and Pearl Onion, Truffle Infused Jus...   Sounds great huh..?  But no, not so much.  Just your average roast chicken...  I've had better elsewhere and again, I didn't taste any truffle.   Portion size was quite large and I ended up leaving more than half.   I guess some folks would appreciate that but I hate wasting food so it just made me sad.My friend had the Surf and Turf (braised beef short rib, butter poached Maine lobster, spinach mousseline) and while the short rib was rich, delicious and fall apart tender, she was disappointed by the beefy sauce that covered entire dish, including the lobster and hence, the lobster flavor. Her husbands Kobe beef special was also just okay, IMO.  I've had far better Kobe at Sent Sovi in Saratoga and the foie at Picasso was superior as well.  Not worth the extra price tag, IMO.Dessert was the cheese plate for me, which was good but featured nothing that I hadn't had before.  Some hard to find artisan cheeses would be nice.   My armagnac was great though.  A first for me, and now I'm corrupted forever. My friends lemon verbena creme brulee was very good.  Light in flavor and texture with a thin crust.  Really nice.  Overall I would go back for the entertainment value of the wine list but only if someone else was paying.  There's simply just better food to be had elsewhere in Vegas.

It's beautiful and has a nice cocktail area that partially overlooks the casino floor which is fun for people watching but... that's where it ends for me.   Maybe it's just me... but when I'm in Vegas I *never* go to Planet Hollywood for anything.  Generally speaking we stick to Palazzo, Wynn, Ceasars and Bellagio.  This stop at PH was a first - and only to go to Koi, which was seriously lacking in customers for a Thursday night in Vegas. We ordered crispy rice with tuna, kobe beef carpaccio, seared tuna with fried red onions, creamy rock shrimp tempura rolls and a dragon roll.   Everything was as good as I remember it from LA with the exception of the crispy rice with tuna.   I do love that dish... but I felt that the rice was over-fried (nearly burnt) and that was disappointing.  If I'm gonna go there, as far as calories go... it better be worth it.   That one was not... but YMMV.  It is a signature dish so on another day it may be better.  Still love the kobe carpaccio and the shrimp rolls.  The seared tuna with red onion could use a few more slices of tuna.  They're really stingy on that one.   It's a nice combination, but I've had it twice now and I don't think I'd order it again.We also tried the kobe pot stickers and they were good but not great. Tasty enough, and I particularly liked the little bit of heat that the dipping sauce had on the finish.. but just not mind blowing overall.  I wouldn't turn one away but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to order it again either.

We sat in the front so that we could people watch, which is always fun... and the staff was great... really down to earth, quick on the draw with the cocktails and very fast to remove the charge for a mistake on the order and comp us a round of drinks.  We ordered the beef tartare (we thought we ordered tuna but that was a mistake), goat cheese baklava, prawn cocktail and the BLT salad to share.   The staff was very helpful in deciding how much would be enough for 3 girls to share but not spoil their dinner later. I thought the beef tartare left a lot to be desired.  I am usually a fan of the dish and the presentation was pretty (they cracked the egg and mixed it tableside) but I just didn't care for the texture (the meat was not very finely ground) or the flavor (a bit bland).I was a fan of the prawns last time but this time around they seemed a bit dried out.  Might skip that next time.The goat cheese baklava is a new favorite.  All three of us thought this was a real standout.   The combination of textures and flavors was wonderful..  from the paper thin phyllo and the creamy, tangy cheese, to the drizzle of honey and sprinkle of pistacios, right down to the bit of frisee salad with candied orange peel.  Would definitely like to have this again... and I ain't sharin'.  ;-)The salad was also very good.  I can't say that it's more exciting than anything else I've had but I think it's great light lunch fare to grab a salad and the baklava and call it a day.Well.. and of course... the famous 405 cocktail has to be on the agenda too.

Many. Televisions.  0_oI'm in town visiting my parents and we heard they had a decent selection of craft beers so we went for lunch to check it out.  Beer selections are diverse and seem to rotate enough to keep it interesting, but our server knew almost nothing about any of the beers and could not help us choose something based on our other preferences.   They would do well to educate their servers better, have them taste the beers and take notes.  My dad and I know a lot about beer so we were fine on our own but how are you going to really sell anything to customers that may be new to the whole craft beer movement?That being said, you can ask for a sample of beers as long as their are not designated as an 11oz pour on the menu.  Why, I don't know.. Again, our server couldn't tell us.Other than that, the food was predictable but good.  Fajitas, burritos, tacos, quesadillas, salads, burgers, sandwiches and wraps.  That sort of thing.   I had the original burger and it had nice chargrilled flavor and a soft buttery bun.  Didn't really need much in the way of condiments.   However, I think it's completely ridiculous that they cannot  cook anything less than medium.  Seriously, is that a law or something?  Lame.  My side salad was large but mostly lettuce...  some variation in vegetables outside of the standard tomato and cucumber would be nice.... but at least it was fresh.  My folks had the wings, and I sampled my moms order since she had the boneless  (I generally think wings are way more trouble than they're worth)...    They were good, and the medium spice was on the hotter side of medium (and rather salty in my opinion).   She had a hard time with them being as spicy as they were.  I probably wouldn't want to eat more than a couple, myself... more due to the salt/tang factor than anything else.    My dad was pretty happy with his regular order of wings and the fries were pretty good and crunchy but again... really salty....  I suppose it goes well with the beer.  Service was attentive aside from our server not being able to guide us toward other beers... and I think the self serve tabletop taps in the bar area are fun (and probably dangerous).    Unfortunately we're unlikely to go back... it just wasn't interesting enough to hold our attention, though it's probably good for game nights and big groups so I'm sure they'll do well.",1,0,Hbj4GbkftebXnkm_1p7i-g,6/12/2013,2,0,31,Restaurant

Sucks if you're a guy though.  Also some friends we were trying to meet somehow got invited to get on the VIP list but then later they asked them how they got on the list.  We got attitude from a bouncer saying ""You can't bring in a shopping (plastic) bag to the club.""  OK, well we went shopping before going to your place.  Luckily, my friends had very large purses so they got creative and shoved the bag in that.  Shoot us.  There's no such thing as coat check here I guess.  They really oughta invest in one of those, it's good for business.  I'm not a fan of hip hop clubs to begin with, but seriously 30 minutes of a SexyBack mash up filled in with clips of various other top 40 of course?  I like a little more variety.  Last time I checked this was Vegas...play something a little more hip.  I went to a club in my boring suburban town that played similar stuff...I guess DJ AM was at this club too perhaps?  I'm sure this place is tons of fun if you arrive early and leave early, but if you get here around midnight or later, forgetaboutit.  No room to dance.  No room to walk.  Get me to the bar for some water please.  Confusing ""EXIT"" signs too.  I had to ask five different staff members how to get out of this joint and I ended up back where I started.  Cover was also $20 which I guess is ""reasonable"" by Vegas standards.  I couldn't even enjoy the cool decor in here because I just wanted to get the eff out of there.  Not my idea of a good time.

I'll have to try some other buffets because this one just didn't do much for me.",1,1,EkaYjkpL3_p2M0NEWsVtIQ,9/26/2007,3,0,5,Restaurant

Andre's has been on my radar for about 4 years now, but I never made it over to MC or to the now closed Downtown location. Some of it was due in part to a lackluster experience at Alize, another Andre venture. I'm excited and happy to say that the experience we had this past trip made me grin and giddy inside. As always, I went online and scoured the website's menu. From past research I knew Andre's offered an off-menu Tasting Menu, any number of courses, basically whatever you can dream up, the Chef will make it happen. A week prior to the trip I emailed Andre's and mentioned the 'must haves' for the evening: -Vitello Tonnato, thinly sliced veal loin, albacore tuna, parmesan cheese, very interesting, unexpected flavor of anchovy. -Blackened Bison Carpaccio, parmesan basket, pickled crimini mushrooms, arugula pesto, the mound of pesto worked perfectly with the bison and I especially enjoyed the puff pastry textural contrast. -Pan-Seared Cold Water Sablefish, miso glaze, caramelized endive, black forbidden rice, basil infused olive oil, learned that this fish is a notch above black cod, beautiful fish and lightly scented with the miso glaze. Superb dish. -Maine Lobster Thermidor, white Mushrooms, tarragon dijon mustard cream sauce, a Andre classic, big thumbs down for me, but the bf enjoyed it, really heavy, the lobster would have been great without being smothered in the creamy mess. -Fig Stuffed Quail, prosciutto wrapped, Roquefort risotto, vincotto, excellent representation of the bird. Perfectly cooked. -Braised Veal Ossobuco Comesquis, risotto milanese, gremolata crust, natural jus, so comforting, robust flavors, but at the same time refined. -Pan Seared Cervana Venison, green asparagus, fingerling potatoes, pomegranate reduction, what a hunk of meat, luscious and delicious to my lips. The rest was at the leisure and discretion of Chef Greg: -Golden Ossetra Caviar,traditional accompaniments, we were offered the last 2 ounces in the restaurant, we went with an ounce, could have EASILY consumed two. Deliciously satisfying, a FANTASTIC way to start a meal. -Chilled Australian Lobster, mango wrapped tail, curried creme fraiche, papaya-serrano pepper salad, from the description on the general menu, I was expecting a dull cold shell-on lobster claw, but the presentation was gorgeous, petite and decidedly unique in flavor profiles. Chef makes his own 'fruit roll-up' to wrap around the lobster. One of the favorites for the evening. -Pan-Seared Foie Gras, caramelized apple, five-spice creme anglaise, port wine reduction, the lightest representation of foie, the richness was expertly cut w/a well thought out contrasting ingredients. -Free-Range Chicken Seared foie gras, tomato, cauliflower croquette, roasted chicken jus, OMG, BEST chicken EVER. I never would have picked this, b/c I try to stay away from chicken in restos, but this was so flavorful, so juicy, I wanted to save some in my cheeks for later. Desserts: There was a trio, which I don't remember, but captured by a photo and a lovely vanilla/choc souffle, perfect sugar dusted crust. The Sommelier is Italian and quite gregarious in nature. Thoroughly enjoyed all his selections to pair with our 14-course journey. Warning for the lightweights: pours are GENEROUS. All the elements Chef Greg lovingly prepared on each dish worked harmoniously together. Wonderful sauces graced each dish and married well with the centerpiece of the course. Old favorites that are staples of fine dining were presented in ways that were innovative. Chef Greg brings a youthful vibrancy to French food in LV. His passion was evident during his numerous visits to see how we were enjoying the meal and at the end of the meal he sat down at our booth to shoot the breeze for a good ten minutes. Make time for this meal, it took us FOUR hours. Extras: Menu is printed with the name of the guest who made the reservation. Love to have a reference point during the evening. Got a tour of the kitchen and met Chef Greg's newest recruit from Nobu LV. With a gorgeous remodelled interior, the established resto has taken a new culinary vision and is better for it!!! This dining experience at Andre's ranks as Number TWO on my Vegas Short List.",8,8,oO8ferAjuNqbLpz73-DdLg,4/23/2009,5,2,80,Restaurant

They will email you several days before to confirm what menu you will be ordering. A text confirmation the day of also appeared on my phone.  Reservations currently are still easy to acquire.  Make sure you are ON TIME, we were in the cab at 6:04PM and got a call. Eeks.The service is a one man show.  He is energetic, efficient, will keep you updated on delays and hovers a bit.  Ambiance is intimate and VERY quiet, don't even remember if there was music, but we felt like we had to whisper even in our large booth.  Dxc3xa9cor is kind of 90s, white with black marble and beaded drapes.  Kimonos are displayed throughout.Toilets are awesome, heated Japanese toilets with all the bootie cleaning bells and whistles.TRUE sadness, their liquor license is still pending for about 6 more months, SO they only serve non-alcoholic drinks.  They comped two glasses of 'champagne' for us.  There are four menus to choose from, one is for repeat guests, so we were not able to choose this time around.  We opted for Omakase 4: Signature, 7 courses and has more of a French spin to the dishes.C1: Warm Appetizer, Clam, Crab, Seaweed and Mochi, seems simple, but was so delicate and fragrant, the crab was reconstructed, so soft and luscious.  C2: Ama-ebi Tar-Tar, citris sorbet, caviar and a peach cream, sounds really odd, but somehow worked harmoniously togetherC3: Steamed dish: foie gras and duck, amazing, who knew fresh wasabi could catapult a dish like this?!?C4: Fish from Tsukiji, this course was so beautifully presented, blew us away.  Ika, Ikura, uni, crab, clams, snapper, different types of ginger, soy beans, plums, knotted ribbon like mochi and salted fish, reminded me of the Chinese version in fried rice, SO good.  We even got to brush and season our fish!  C5: Simmered fish, buttery, lovely silken tofu, reminded me of a really elegant claypot type dish, scallions were cut with precision and balanced the richness of the dishC6: Grilled Wagyu A5 beef, on the leaner side of the spectrum, so tender, all the natural flavors coming through, loved the wasabi mash and the bamboo shoots, I don't typically like bamboo, but they really take care to ensure they are cooked and seasoned properly here.  C7: Desserts, Asian pear, red bean and chestnut, so simple, fresh and wonderful.  The tiramisu was also good, but my favorite was the red bean.The A5 comes out with a birth certificate.  This was SO entertaining.  We literally talked about this the rest of the night.  According to their website, not only do they get their fish from Tsukiji, they have their own fish buyer.  Every fish course was top notch.Special: the server explained fresh wasabi and the shark skin grater and even let me grate and taste my product!  Never been to a fine dining establishment who uses Square payment.  So progressive!  Such exciting food and techniques!  Memorable and wonderful.

The dining room was mod, Jetson-esque, breathtaking and swank.  I was impressed by the carefully strung glass globes and the white domed booths.  I felt like I was on another planet.  The food is not cheap here.  To balance out the prices, the portioning is quite large.  An entree is definitely enough to satiate one's hunger.  The bread basket is pretty impressive, with 5 types of bread, but sadly, most were chewy and cold.  The only one I enjoyed was the salty bread, which was similar to a croissant, nice and flaky.  The butter had an interesting twist, bits of peanut in the butter and also served was the standard plain version.  Chef sent out an amuse to start our evening: a compilation of prosciutto, fig, Parmesan, and balsamic glaze.  The other components set off the sweetness of the grilled fig.Normally the compliment of the Chef is a BITE, this one was a few bites, so I knew we had made the right choice not to order an appetizer, to save room for the main event and DESSERT!The menu is extensive, catering to both the conservative and adventurous eater.  I chose the Bison Tenderloin.  I would order this ten times out of ten over cow.  Lean, moist, tender, full of natural flavor, and ZERO gaminess.  It tasted like REALLY good COW.  Yum.  Came with a side of veggies, all of which were grilled and seasoned perfectly.  It's important to have veggies FREE on the side.  My compadres had:Thai Snapper, standard, rice was excellent, but the fish was salty.Duck, above average, but nothing special.Roasted Maine Lobster, EXCELLENT, great contrasting textures and flavors.Shared Side:Elbow pasta, black truffle, ham, gruyre cheese-DELICIOUS, a bread crumb crust would have put it over the top.The pastry chef has numerous accolades for his creations.  We were not shy about ordering:Chocolate dome, mango chutney, passion fruit sorbet, a bit rich for my taste, but everyone else devoured it.Chocolate Tea Tart, beautiful presentation, perfect for dark choc lovers.Rhubarb coconut, light and the rhubarb was a nice departure from the standard fruit selections.At the end of the meal fresh madelines are presented to the table, we were stuffed, but all of us managed to fit the buttery morsel into our mouths.  Nutella is provided with the sweet treat.  The BEST madeline I've had in my life, slightly sweet, right out of the oven, and crisp edges.  After dinner we wanted to check out the famed lounge.  From the stark white of the dining room, to dark chocolates and reds, we were transported once again.  I was stunned by the creativity in the use of design and space.As for Vegas Restaurant with a view, this hip restaurant tops my list for ambiance and quality of cuisine.",11,2,zM4Da_OKusVWhp_86AkZYQ,5/19/2007,5,2,78,Restaurant

We were happy and surprised to find our sommelier from Restaurant Charlie had relocated to Switch.  His pairings were spot on and much more reasonable in price. We did not mention a price cap, but it was only an additional $75/pp for the vino.  Switch is supposed to be the premier restaurant at the Encore, but I was expecting a bit more luxury and elegance.

We noticed that a different server brought out each of the dishes, and our drinks were replenished immediately.  (Managers seemed friendly, courteous and comfortable, not uptight and angry-looking like others around the hotel.)  Spanish tapas are quite different from, say, Italian preparations.  So, one should not disparage the Pan Manchego and expect chunky bruschetta.  The Pan Manchego was a perfect start with excellent flavor.  In fact, pretty much everything we ordered was excellent.  The gazpacho came with the vegetables chopped up and elegantly arranged in a bowl, over which the waiter then poured the purxc3xa9ed tomato base (again, not chunky as we might be used to).  Tuna tiradito was nice, but very small portioned.  Hubby asked the waitress if there were live octopi in the back because the dish we had was the freshest and most tender pieces we've ever had.  I've already forgotten what else we ordered, but I do remember the luscious chocolate cake, which was molten in the middle and paired with a mango sorbet.

The food here was tasteless.  I tried very hard to convince myself and my table of colleagues that Blossom was aiming for the highly refined palate, and we were to ""experience the essence of ginger"" in our very bland potstickers.  There was hope in the delicious bowls of vegetarian hot and sour soup (although not very hot and very expensive at $10 a bowl -- more like a cup).  After this, our hopes were dashed repeatedly, first with the kung pao chicken that had no ""pao"" in it and second with the crispy sea bass that had large pieces of bone.  One person received a piece with vertebrae and hardly any fish meat to try.  I ordered the tofu and shiitake mushroom dish, which on most accounts tends to be bland to begin with.  I enjoyed this the most; the tofu was high quality and silky, and the mushrooms were fresh.  Unfortunately, my table mates were disappointed even with the hot sauces and chiles they requested on the side.  If you like real authentic Chinese food, you will be disappointed by the lack of flavor and the high prices here.Service was excellent, though.  And the tea was very good -- similar to what I have had in Taiwan.It's interesting to note that along with the rest of the ARIA resort, the restaurant is poorly designed.

You're CRAZY!!!That actually may be a true statement about me, since my mother has never had me tested! But nevertheless, I did not enjoy the charred, ashy flavor of their meats (particularly the ribeye steak sandwich). I didn't add any additional toppings (which might have helped), but I wanted to taste the purity of the meat. Also, the ratio of meat to veggies was ridiculously lopsided with thick cut roasted veggies being probably 70% of the sandwich. Considering the cost of the sandwich, I would have expected more meat.  Although I liked the burger much more, I was not a fan of the hard breads they use to compliment their sandwiches. I also did not enjoy the strong flavor of the roasted potatoes and the beef empanadas were just okay. My tweenage kids took a bite and refused to eat any more of their food. They have a serious dislike for anything that has a burnt flavor and I honestly couldn't argue with them. I love a decent char, but today it was like eating cigarette butts from an ashtray. I felt so bad because I really hyped this place up to them after reading reviews and getting recommendations prior to my visit. So I took them down the street for a bowl of pho to make amends. Another visit may yield a better result, but as a first-time experience goes, the food did not live up to the hype. The restaurant itself, the decor and the staff on the other had were awesome! What an eclectic collection of humans! FINAL THOUGHTSThis place came highly recommended, which makes me dread writing this review. I definitely don't want this to be a slap in the face to all the awesome yelpers who suggested Gaucho as THEE place to visit for my one day trip to Pittsburgh, but I gotta be honest. Besides, there are so many positive reviews here that I doubt mine will even be noticed.

My kids hated the super charred flavor of their burgers and rib eye steak sandwich, so I had to quickly find an alternative eating venue to satisfy their teenage hunger. Although Gauchos is Pittsburgh's highest rated restaurant, I must admit I was not a fan, but I was not nearly as disgusted as my kids.  We ate a few bites there and decided to give Vietnam's Pho a try since we'd parked practically right in front of it anyway. Yelp reviews had the overall rating here @ 3.5 stars, so I figured I wouldn't be too disappointed. However, the lack of customers and weirdly abandoned looking entrance made me pause. The entrance looks like the lobby of an old apartment building. You then walk through more doors into another space that serves as their to-go sandwich shop before walking through yet another door into the main dining area. It was dark and totally weird with a fish tank dead smack in the middle of the room, but we were hungry and decided to give it a try anyway. So glad we did!The pho came out piping hot in a nice size bowl. I was immediately impressed that I barely saw any oil droplets on the surface. This is either an indication that they don't cook their broth using beef bones/stock or they meticulously skim the surface to give you the cleanest broth experience possible. Honestly, it may be the former! But that old familiar pho flavor I love was apparent, so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and assume they did the latter. FINAL THOUGHTSGood pho at a great price. This is not the place you'd come for ambiance, but I'd recommend coming here for the pho... fuh-sho! 2016/74",113,108,J1SfYjB4mINMF4H-B9_sGw,5/3/2016,4,87,7,Restaurant

This way you can taste all of the different sensations.  Pretty pricey, pretty tiny.  But definitely worth trying.",0,0,CxULN0lIj9spBHeC_wVG7g,10/19/2007,4,0,10,Restaurant

Two salsas actually.  The red salsa (salsa roja) has punch.  You can taste an exciting splash of fresh individual flavors instead of the usual tomato-onion-lemon.  And it also comes with a spicy green salsa (salsa de tomatillo aka salsa verde) that has a great spicy kick.  We ordered the ground beef tacos and the waitress didn't flinch when I asked for things like ""no onions"" and ""no sour cream"" and they came to our table perfectly.  I like it when both the servers and the cooks pay attention.  Needless to say the tacos were impeccable.  Flavorful and fresh.  They came with a side of cilantro rice with a few beans as garnish.  I could say it was slightly overcooked, but it was a nice alternative to the usual spoonful of plain beans and rice.  They have more tequilas than your average saloon!   An impressive list of martinis, margaritas and enough tequilas for several rounds of shots without using the same tequila twice.  Just remember the old saying ""One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor..."" before ordering too many.At $22 for lunch and all we had were tacos and diet cokes, it was a little high, but more of a unique experience than I expected and well worth the investment.

The chicken and beef never creep me out like some mom and pop taco shops around town.  The best thing about standing in line and ordering here is you can see your meal being made and ask for exactly what you want on it.  Customizing your chow has never been easier or more fun.  Chicken with corn salsa, black beans and guac on your burrito?  Why not?!The guacamole and corn salsa both have too many red onions imho.  But other than that I really like Chipotle.  Their chips are made on premises, crispy, lightly salted with a dash of lime juice.  And I often get the guac anyway because it tastes so fresh.  I get the crispy (vs soft) shell tacos often.

And if you tried the soba noodles and didn't like it you still shouldn't write off soba.  It's also prepared completely differently in Japan.  Sushi 101's Americanizations of these two dishes really botch it for me.That said, the nigiri, sushi and maki seem high quality and made fresh to me, although I don't eat them very often.  I go for the izakaya items like yakitori (chicken skewers) which are pretty reliable.  This place has the best asparagus and beef skewers I've had outside of Japan.  A lot of the other items are hit or miss so you're just going to have to poke around.  It's worth a try but unfortunately seems best if you go in with ""low"" expectations.  I've been able to find a few things that work for me and it's very affordable so worth coming back if you peg a few things you like.",1,0,JU9Yg7ZGgbGt50VjrVB5mw,2/12/2008,3,0,30,Restaurant

The problem is that I really feel like 4 stars is too few, but five stars is too many.  4.5 would be perfect here.  Not perfect for a rating, because 5 would be perfect of course, but it would be the perfect rating for this dinner.  So it will have to get a 4 star.  They just didn't quite make it to 5 stars.  Sorry, guys.With another restaurant week on us, we decided to browse the menus a bit and see if we can come up with something different.  Always like to try and come up with somewhere new to go.  That's when I noticed The Speedway Club.  I knew they were there, of course, but never thought about going.  In fact, I thought you had to be a member to get in (as it turns out, you do, but not during restaurant week).  As a bonus, their menu was one of the best on the list.  So we made reservations.For an appetizer, we chose the onion rings and warm pimento cheese dip (with crackers).  These were also served with a nice selection of breads.  For perhaps the first time in my adult life, I didn't get a refill on bread.  I don't even know if they offered a refill on bread.  The appetizers were both solid offerings.  Not excellent, but quite good.I decided on the filet mignon for dinner.  I'm usually a fan of ribeye, but the filet sounded really good.  Denise went with the salmon.   Both were good.  I found that the risotto that came with the salmon was better than the salmon itself.  It was that good.  On the steak, I was floored.  It was un-freaking-believable.This just might be the best steak in the QC.  A small portion (6 oz), served with roasted garlic and a parmesan-crusted potato cake, it was the best piece of steak I've head in a really long time.  Maybe ever.  I just about ordered my dessert to go so I didn't ruin the taste.  I just wish that I could get into the place on a regular basis to taste that filet.The desserts were good, but nothing compared to that steak.Why the 4.5?  The first thing is the noise (and not from the track).  It is a really cool view, looking over the track, and being able to see what's going on is nice.  But for a nicer environment, the place can get a little loud.  So much so that it's tough to hear what the person on the other side is saying.  The desserts are good, and the appetizers are good, but not great.  The service was attentive all night, and I would like to give them more than a 4, but not quite a 5.Sweet Tea Report: Yes, I ordered a sweet tea.  The server even told me he made it, and it was sweet.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very sweet.  So I'd probably suggest passing unless you like just average tea.  I didn't figure this into the rating, as the tea is drinkable, but it's just not that sweet.",3,3,XWr1_3hD-HMtHIKxjBVWjg,7/23/2010,4,0,73,Restaurant

Love the servers, some of the nicest I've ever come across. Love the menu, as everything is mouthwatering, or close to it.Food comes out lightning fast, like you're still wondering if you ordered the right stuff, and bam! there it is, leaving you to decide by looking at it. The flavors are also spot on. Even the televisions nail it (at least when we were there), with some Asian game shows, along the lines of MXC, subtitles and everything. Nice.What isn't quite right is the execution of the dishes.- Ramen mac & cheese: Flavor was good while warm, but unfortunately after a minute or two, that cheese turns into a government cheese glop, which is not attractive at all. The crispy pork skins added nice texture, until dissolving into the glop.- Wings (specifically soy garlic, but I suspect on others): The flavor was again spot on, but the breading was so thick, it was tough to get at the meat below. I think this was a breading and not some alien, radioactive Troma-movie like super-thick skin, but I really don't know. Our son loved them, however.- Pork belly: great flavor, but totally mixed textures. The meat was great. The fatty portions, in bits, was good. The cracklins were often too tough to eat due to fear of breaking a tooth. Next time, the pulled pork would probably make a better choice.- Buns: Related to above, trying to make sandwiches with pork belly (and other items) was a good choice, and with pulled pork, would probably be an excellent decision.- Sweet potato swirl: Again, amazing flavor, but one of the oddest things I've ever eaten. If you can get any to your mouth, it dissolves in cloudy goodness, but getting it there is a challenge. Bonus: If you save it, take it home and chill it in the fridge, it becomes a lot easier to eat (though you still get the stickiness of the sauce on your fingers).- Potato swirl on a stick: Also great flavors, but a little unwieldy, not quite as bad as the sweet potato however. At this point, we were just slowing down. Had as an appetizer, this would have probably been better.End result: Amazing flavors, even presentation is great. But eating some things wasn't the easiest, and definitely messy. Think fajitas, but worse. Probably not a first date place.

The long-awaited return trip to Bikinis is now in the books.  The result?  I have to give them a big thumbs up.  In fact, the turnaround is nothing short of amazing.  Why?  Read on...The very first original impression we had was one of smoke, and naturally they are the beneficiaries of the NC smoking ban on this one.  If you can't smoke inside, then there isn't going to be much smoke, right?But the change goes well beyond that.  It's like the whole place has had a complete and total makeover.  Rather than the dingy, poorly lit past-their-prime interior, there is an entirely different vibe.  Though the pics that are on the business page appear to be from a different location than the Charlotte one, they aren't entirely off the mark, and will give you an idea of what they look like now.Some 30 flat-screen sets surround the place - bar, seating area, everywhere.  They are just all over.  There is rock (probably fake, but it does the job) and wood, rather than what appeared to be frayed carpet on the last visit - really strange to see at a new restaurant!  Even the staff seemed more upbeat rather than beaten down like they were the last time we stopped in.The changes extend to the lowly menu, which also had a makeover.  Instead of what appeared to be typewritten sheets in a binder, now there is a slick glossy two-pager with food that really whets the appetite (you can see this online if you want).  It was actually difficult to decide what to order.The staff was excellent.  Naturally they were mostly made up of college-age women, and they were all in short shorts and bikini tops, but they were all friendly, rather than standoffish like they were before.  Big improvement.  Not your thing?  Totally get it - but it's miles ahead of where they were.On the food - monster steps above where they were.  There are some weak spots, but also some huge gains.  The tater tots were tasty, but mostly a gooey mess.  The Buffalo Burger was solid, but a bit of a mess as well.  Perhaps less sauce, or maybe the same amount, but a few seconds on the grill to get the taste without quite as much liquid in the basket, would have been a plus.  The sliders were good, but not outstanding.The real star of the show?  The Heart Attack Burger.  Fried egg, bacon, crispy onion straws, pimento cheese and chipotle mayo. all  cooked to perfection and served on a kaiser bun.  This may just be the best burger in the QC.  Totally would not have expected it, but I'm glad that I found it, as now I know where to get it again.If you're after a unique dessert, they also have a fried cheesecake.  Think cheesecake wrapped up in an egg roll wrapper and deep fried to get an idea of what it's like.  Tastes a bit like deep fried ice cream, or a cheesecake inside a churro, but you get to linger on the cheesecake because it gets a bit thick in the middle.  The ice cream is actually better than the cheesecake however.  Still excellent.Next to the Heart Attack and the interior improvements, the service really stood out as being a big improvement.  From Nick (manager) to Brittany (both of them) and all the rest, they really made for a much better experience this time around.  We took our 15 year old and he had a blast - pics with the girls were the envy of his friends.  And to Kevin - thanks for insisting that we give it another try!Sweet Tea Report: Nice.  Near the top of the heap, good sweetness and very drinkable.  Refilled regularly, which is always a plus!So, did Kevin buy a better review?  Only in the sense that he actually seemed to listen to customers (myself and others).

The Bun Trio was excellent, with fresh-tasting components, and instead of a usual shrimp, served with chicken. It was so large I had to bring some home, an unusual feat for me.

Definitely be aware that this place is tough to find if you don't know where you are going, or if you are trying to give people directions.  Signage is almost non-existent.  For that reason, GPS may come in handy.Staff is very helpful, and at least when we were there, kept glasses full (however, we were their only table!).I would also agree that they can get pricey.  Their personal pizza is a good size for one person, but at $9, it doesn't really seem like that great of a value.  If you go to Big Guy's down the street, you can get a single slice that is about that size for half the price, or you can go to Little Caesar's and get an entire pizza that is larger for just more than half the price.  Is either as good?  Probably not.  But if you're feeding the kids and want to keep the price down, it might be important.Sweet Tea Report: Not too sweet, but very drinkable.  I personally prefer a bit more sweetness (okay, syrup-like would be good).  But this goes down really easily, so it's a good match with their pie.  Very high up on the list.",2,0,3SSVfd7e_2KyZ9Sf5xOIgg,7/25/2010,3,0,43,Restaurant

None of us had tried this place, but hey what the heck?  The restaurant looked pretty inviting, and it was pretty packed with people.Before I comment on the food, I must say that I really do like the ambiance here.  The place is called Switch because there are 3 different ""environments"" that is being switched every 30 minutes.  They are kind of fun; however, I much rather would have preferred to switch every hour.  We were in the restaurant for 3 hours... so that means we saw the walls and windows switch 6 times.  The wow factor was pretty much gone after the first few times.As for the food, our group got a ""Seafood Extravaganza for Four"" to split ($150).  The appetizer included the following:  oysters on the half shell, jumbo shrimp, ahi tuna tartar, Maine lobster, bay scallop ceviche, and Alaskan king crab legs.  I personally loved the bay scallop ceviche.  The oysters on a half shell, jumbo shrimp, Maine lobster, and Alaskan king crab legs were all good and fresh.  I didn't like the ahi tuna tartar.  The tuna wasn't fresh.I ordered the Bone-in Rib Eye with the bordelaise sauce ($52).  The sauce was a recommendation from our waiter.  I ordered my rib eye medium rare, and it was perfect.  Usually Restaurant cook the steaks too done for me.  The only complaint I had about this dish was that it was a bit too salty.  The meat itself and the medium rare cooking were both perfect.Some of the other dishes that my friends ordered were the following:- Sauteed Sonoma Foie Gras (appetizer) - I took a bite to taste and it was delicious.  The sauce on the dish was really tasty.- Filet - also the same comment as I had about being a bit too salty.  This friend ordered his Filet also ""medium rare"".- Slow Simmered Short Rib of Beef - he liked his dish; however, the portion was a bit small.- Roasted Lamb Chop - she liked it; however, said the dish didn't have enough salt.The seasonal wild mushrooms on the side was delicious.  I ordered a Lobster Mac & Cheese just to try.  (I love Mac & Cheese... even though it doesn't exactly pair with my entree).  Anyway, the lobster flavor and cheese was really light.  I felt like it needed a small kick in the Mac & Cheese.My friends had ordered their mojitos as a cocktail.  The flavors are pretty good, but it doesn't really have alcohol in it.All in all, it was a pretty fun experience.  The food was good.  I wished my Rib Eye wasn't as salty as it was.  The seafood extravaganza had really fresh seafood (except for the tuna tartar).  I liked the atmosphere a lot, but also wished the walls didn't change every 30 minutes, maybe every hour or so.  I don't know if I would come back again for the price (my share was $130 with tip).  It's worth a trip to go to this restaurant once for the experience.http://www.encorelasvegas.com/#/dining/switch/",2,2,xn6VLOmG18iS3iBL7hkcqQ,4/12/2009,3,1,62,Restaurant

I loved that they trimmed the steak *and brought the trimmings on a separate plate!* Great cut and grilled perfectly to the medium rare we requested. I chose the crab cakes and they were excellent. Very well loaded with crab and little filling, a very nice taste and texture. Perfect crab.Dessert was the only imperfect course.  I chose the apple cake and while the cake was very good, being topped with a rather hard ginger cookie made it difficult to eat. The deconstructed elderberry cheesecake that Mrs. chose was the better option.Service was top notch excellent.

Turning to Yelp, I put the car in gear and headed towards South Park and Piedmont Row. Quite busy when we arrived, there was no reasonable parking to be had. It seems that some people have a different definition of ""compact"" that somehow includes the Toyota Land Cruiser and Mercedes S-class. So I handed over my car to the complimentary valet and we headed inside.Despite not having a reservation, the hostess was able to bring us to a table immediately. She left us with the regular menus as well as the Queen's Feast menu plus the wine list. Classy surroundings, I felt seriously under dressed in jeans and a polo shirt. It just has the feel that something fancier would have fit in better.While it took our waiter a few minutes to arrive for our drinks order (no, they don't have a non-alcohol wine), he was knowledgeable, friendly and exhibited a welcoming spirit. I chose to order from the special menu, starting with the mussels and then having the garlic and mushrooms pappardelle for main course. A good sized portion of mussels arrived in a creamy sauce that had onions and was soaked up well by the fantastic sliced French bread that was brought to the table. If you're a mussels fan, you'll love these.Rather than try the soup, my wife read the Yelp reviews and went straight to the goat cheese and caramelized onion tart. Thank goodness, she let me have one bite. Heavenly. Absolutely excellent! And for her main course, she selected the roast duck breast. Medium slices of tender duck on top of a parsnip puree with roasted Brussels sprouts. Amazingly good stuff.For dessert, we split a creme brxc3xbblxc3xa9e. Perfectly candied shell on top, creamy filling with two perfect raspberries as garnish.I kid you not, my wife said ""That was the best meal I have ever had in the United States.""

No beef, no pork, not even chicken or turkey. No shellfish, but fish including salmon and mahi mahi is still cool as are eggs and dairy. It's been an interesting time trying to eat around this new program, especially since my daughter and I are unrepentant flesh-craving carnivores.For this week's family brunch, I offered to try a restaurant completely focused on vegan and vegetarian options. Fern hit the spot with great reviews and options that I felt would minimally inconvenience us meat eaters while giving my wife options other than salad.As Mrs. K. is still figuring out vegan, I could see that the menu was a little complicated. So while we studied it, I got us started with coffee (with almond milk. Stevia and Sugar-in-the-raw on the table) and the cinnamon rolls. The rolls arrived and we were able to place our brunch order. Tasty and doughy, not too sweet at all. Yum.Sausage and gravy for my wife, Mediterranean scramble for daughter and the zucchini/spinach benedict for me. It was clear by what was left when we asked for the check who had enjoyed their meal most thoroughly. It was me - my plate was clear. The zucchini fritters were tender and moist, sort of like a crab cake except without crab. Topped with steamed spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise, really tasty. I'd recommend it thoroughly.The scramble wasn't that great, according to daughter. Rather bland, she said. And she didn't care for the quinoa. Oh well. Mrs said that the biscuits were too cakey but the gravy was good.For sides, I had the crispy braised fingerling potatoes. It was as close to home fries as you're going to get and they were perfectly crunchy and salty. The sweet potatoes were good (tender and sweet), but not the best choice for their brunch meals.Service was excellent. The coffee was great. And the price was pretty decent.  I don't know that we'd return for brunch, but only because it's challenging for the carnivores. Maybe lunch or dinner next time.

Maybe a special fork would have been useful because after about two of them, you just give up and go at it with fingers. At the end, you're left with a plate of butter and garlic that's perfect for the table bread.The caesar salad was a big miss. A platter of romaine lettuce topped with croutons that did not seem handmade and then shredded mozzarella cheese? With a small pot of sharp caesar dressing on the side. Me, I prefer my salad dressing already tossed into the salad and with actual parmesan cheese. We took a couple bites and then left the rest.The main course was great. My wife opted for the Chicken Marsala. The chicken was tender and the mushrooms and sauce were flavorful and rich. The marinara sauce on the pasta was a little sweet and heavy with basil.I chose the Chicken Gorgonzola. The sauce was very rich and very cheesy. Lots of mushrooms in there. Where my wife's chicken was tender, mine was a little rubbery and tough. Not enough to send back, but enough that it took some effort to cut with the steak knife. Since hers was perfect, I'm thinking that mine was just an off one.For dessert, we got a tiramisu to share. Almost entirely lady fingers and mascarpone custard, there was no rum or coffee soaked into it. Sweet and tasty, but not quite tiramisu.Overall, a good meal and great service from Tiffany.

Awesome.Looking over the menu, I had made my decision from the rather expensive listing of steaks and side dishes. That changed when our waiter - Matt, who was awesome - went over the evening's specials. Suddenly, the idea of a trio of small filet mignons was what I wanted and each with a different topping/sauce. Massive wine list but only a small list of beers and an even smaller list of local beers. In fact, just one. OMB Copper. All three of us started with the wedge salads. These were good portions with plenty of blue cheese to go with the lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Not a bad deal for $4!When they arrived, the steaks looked perfect. Three small filets, each in a different sauce. The first two, a bearnaise and an Oscar, I enjoyed thoroughly. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of sauce on top. But by the time I had cut into the third one, it was no longer quite so perfect. More overdone than I ordered and a bit of a tougher cut, especially since the first two were so good. Bummer.For dessert, I let Matt talk me into the bread pudding. It was... fair. Just not that great with not enough taste and some of the topping was over done. I wouldn't have this again.On the pros list, no wait for a seat when we had a reservation, excellent service from Matt, a local beer choice, great salad, and great steaks.On the cons list, the booth was a bit too tight for the three of us to sit comfortably. Perhaps another inch or two, please? Only one choice for a local beer.

The tempura rock shrimp were excellent, just a bunch of fried shrimp on a plate (popcorn-shrimp size). We tried the house special (a rainbow roll) and Eel sushi. Both were good, but not my favorite rolls I'd ever had-actually kind of plain. For dessert the bento box, essentially a souffl",1,1,VuiRCSLJyufTaBMwZBOlyg,8/11/2008,4,0,14,Restaurant

It was fantastic.We made reservations, which are recommended...and if you want a booth, supposedly you have to make those months in advance. Who knows where they'll be eating that far in advance? Not this girl. Anyway, the tables were fine although a booth would have been slightly cozier. The service was great! Attentive, but not intrusive and in no way did we ever feel rushed. The wine list was extensive, but not overwhelming. We started with the cheese plate followed by our main entree and vegetables. It was just the right amount and made deliciously! I had the scallops and they were divine! Besides the quality of the food, the ambiance and visual presentation is top notch. The decor is rustic, yet classy. They know how to set the mood with dim lighting and dining by candlelight. The food is thoughtfully placed on the dishes and is picture perfect and ready to eat.I love that this place is local and rotates its menu to reflect what food is seasonal. I also like that they support area farms and add where they get their items on the bottom of their menu. It's like a win-win-win: us-them-community.

I haven't lived near one before so I was intrigued and excited to shop somewhere new and possibly help out on spending less for groceries. This store is fairly new and my GPS did not pick up the street name; however, it is conveniently located on Charlottetown and Kings (in the same shopping area as Best Buy). For my first time being in a Trader Joe's, it took me a moment to get acquainted. It was smaller in size than other grocery stores I've been to and it didn't seem to have well labeled areas because it took me a while to locate what I needed. I went in with a pretty lenthy list and found that it didn't have everything I was looking for (i.e., jalapexc3xb1o, cream of mushroom soup) or offer a wide variety to select from (i.e., one type of sour cream). In addition, some of the labels look similar (e.g., writing, style, color) and it took me longer to distinguish which product was organic, free-range, etc. Previous reviewers mentioned that it has lower prices than some of the other higher end stores (e.g., TJ's peanut butter is approximately $1 less than what I've found at other stores). I agree that many items are less expensive, but not all items. Since I wasn't able to find everything on my list at TJ's I went back to Earth Fare to get the rest. I found that some things at EF were either less or similar to the same cost (e.g., TJ's unsalted butter was $1 more and blue corn chips were the same cost).Past my criticisms...I found that I am a fan of Trader Joe's! If you bring your own bag, they enter you into a drawing to possibly be the winner of $25 worth of Trader Joe's products. In addition, I like the beautiful selection of flowers that greets you the moment you walk in. I appreciated that the store was bright and clean as well. They have a nice wine section and you may find yourself spending a while trying to select the ""right"" one. The employees are very helpful and friendly! And if you know prices of products you regularly purchase, you can distinguish which are less expensive at TJ's and help out your pocketbook.If you are in need of quick, staple items Trader Joe's is a great choice. If, however, you need specific things and want a variety of options you may want to go to a bigger store.",4,2,bsiWHFJRcEOTf0R8XQyulQ,3/7/2009,4,0,49,Restaurant

A friend had recommended Light Rail Restaurant and said she eats there often when they are in this part of Charlotte. So with that recommendation we (a large group of us) went for dinner without a reservation. When we got there we were warmly greeted and made to feel quite welcome. We were led to the room in the back which can seat a lot of people. We were a dozen and they quickly set up the tables for us to have a long table and this was a private room for us only for the meal. The menu really has something for everyone. It has grilled meats, fried meats, you can eat healthily or pig out. I had the Friday special, which was pork over a bed of stuffing (kind of like Thanksgiving turkey), with a side salad,rolls and cabbage. Others had the meatloaf (which looks wonderful), grilled shrimp, the grilled chicken, so many choices. All of the meals come with choice of bread, two sides (okra, greens, beets). There was even pudding on the side list, so you can have a dessert without paying more. This is not a fancy restaurant, and the food is not complicated food. I would equate it to diner food that you find while driving in New Jersey. I say this in a complimentary way. I love diner food in New Jersey. So if you want to have a good meal, for a reasonable price (less than $15 per person including tip, tax, meal, drink, dessert), then this is your place. Also a shout out to our waitress Terry, she did a great job. Everything was brought as ordered and she had a fun personality.

Palm is the kind of place where that deal is worth it. The service was fine, although our server was a bit of the anxious type. I started with the mixed green salad, which was completely unmemorable. I say this because I literally had to go to the restaurant's website to figure out what the heck I ate for the first course. Apparently the mixed green salad. I vaguely remember the baby tomatoes.However, we also had some sides as appetizers, which were truly phenomenal. The green beens were all oiled up with chunks of bacon in them. Wow.

Located next to the shopping mall underneath an apartment building (I do not want to be associated with people who live in apartments basically on top of a mall. Ick.), the Cowfish restaurant seems wildly popular. It has nearly 500 reviews in the solid red-orange range of four stars. My wife and I couldn't get a table at 4:30 on Jan. 1, so we sat at the bar.Here you can get sushi, or burgers, or a combo of both. I guess this means your health nut friends and your obese unhealthy friends can all get together in one restaurant! For that, Cowfish, many kudos. In fact, more Restaurant should be heading in this direction. And for that, you deserve four stars. Below is why I knocked it down a notch.Step inside the bathroom and you hear automated recordings of a man and a woman taking on a faux North Carolina hick, redneck accent and spewing off a number of homespun axioms. I wish I could remember a few, but they were things like, ""Don't pee on my back and call it rain!"" and they were repeated ad nauseam. It was truly difficult to bear. The next reason Cowfish drops a notch is simply due to its service. It took forever to get a food order, and when we did, the food arrived fairly quickly. I ordered some edamame and sushi. The edamame was good, and not too salty. The sushi was also good: spicy tuna and vegetarian rolls. They were wrapped pretty well, you got a good piece of fish in there, and it tasted fresh.On the walls are the paintings that are humorous take-offs on famous paintings or art. Some seem mildly offensive or distasteful. One of them is an Asian Mona Lisa. What? Another is a rendering of Picasso's Guernica, which depicts the German bombing of a Basque region during the Spanish Civil War. It's a pretty gut-wrenching painting of a solemn topic. But in the Cowfish's rendering, all the character, people suffering and fleeing from a Nazi bombing, are COWS. It's just not in good taste. Granted, some of the painting are actually funny.To top it of, after I paid, my server started awkwardly joking with me as I fiddled with my phone. ""I know you want to dance,"" he quipped to the loud pop music pumping in the background. It's okay. Go ahead and dance."" Where was all this attention when I wanted to order a meal?

You know what?  It's not nearly as cool as it sounds.  Imagine my disappointment, after getting onto the VIP list with the help of a local connection, but it's the truth.  (The Foundation Room is open to the hoi polloi on Mondays, or else there wouldn't be much point in reviewing it, would there?)Okay, yes, it does feel pretty awesome when you walk up to the unobtrusive podium in the lobby, murmur your name to the hostess behind the desk, and get waved through the ropes to the single elevator.  There's no need to punch buttons, because it only goes one place - straight up to the Foundation (ironically, located at almost the very top of Mandalay Bay).  When the elevator doors open, you're greeted with the kind of quiet, plush elegance that tells you you really don't belong.  The club consists of a series of rooms branching off to either side of a main lounge.  From the lounge, you can also reach the restaurant and the balcony, which really does have a stunning view of the Strip - the best in the city, if the hype is to be believed.  It's pretty spectacular, and so the balcony is always crowded with people wrestling between their desire to gawk and their desire to look cool and jaded.And yes, the decor is not only tasteful but actually beautiful - romantically dim lights, opulent Indian and Asian art and decorations, and exotic wood paneling and carvings.  Smaller, private rooms off the hallways are reserved for private parties, but a quick peek revealed low, plush couches and more elaborate furnishings and art.  The main lounge is where the bar is, but good luck muscling your way up to the front and getting served - and if you do, you'll find yourself paying $12 for a small drink that's mostly ice.  Yum.  A second, smaller room has another bar and (at least the night I was there) a complimentary hookah table set up on one side, with three hookahs bubbling away in different flavors.  Bowls of plastic-wrapped disposable mouthpieces were set out, so you'd just grab one and get ready to puff - an uncharacteristically free bonus in an otherwise insanely overpriced place.The music wasn't anything super-special - muted trance-house with a vaguely Asian flavor in the lounge, and more hip-hop in the smaller room.  But everyone is too busy looking hott and being way too cool to actually want to dance, so all there really is to do here is silently judge each other's outfits and suck on your expensive ice drink.  This is okay for about an hour, but then it gets old fast.I'm glad I went to the Foundation Room for two reasons: to see that magnificent view, and to have my illusions about exclusive members-only clubs demolished.  Yeah, it's posh and people are probably wearing outfits that cost more than my annual salary, but you'll have way more fun slurping $2 beaker shots and dancing to disco at Gay Corners, where everyone's allowed in.

The building is mysteriously huge, with super-high ceilings and a dining area that goes on for miles, but it does fill up at peak times on the weekends.  The decor is nothing fancy - bare white walls livened up with some wall hangings or framed pictures - but you're not there for the ambience, you're there for tons of spicy food.When you sit down, they'll plop some pappadom down in front of you (those crunchy cracker-like flatbreads), plus a mint-cilantro sauce and a sweet-and-sour sauce.  I love this stuff, but be judicious in your use of the spicy sauce, because water service can be a bit slow here.Everything here is good, especially the garlic naan.  The tandoori chicken is yummy, as is the rogan josh, palak paneer, and tikka masala.  Entrees range from $10--12, although they also have special tasting menus (including salad, rice, and dessert) that range from $15--22.  They have a lunch buffet on weekdays that's also an excellent value.  And there's a pretty good selection of beer and wine, including a few Indian beers, to go with your meal.Nothing fancy decor- or ambience-wise, Gandhi nevertheless delivers good and reasonably priced Indian food in a quiet and pleasant setting.

I'd visited Vegas many times before we finally made it to this place, because it keeps weird hours, and always seemed to be closed when we wanted to go.  We finally caught it on a night when it was open, and it remains my first and best hookah lounge experience.When you enter, there's an interior ""courtyard"" dividing the Greek cafe on the right, and the hookah lounge on the left.  There are tables set up here for ""sidewalk"" dining, and this is also where they seat the overflow on the hookah lounge's waiting list.  Service isn't great out here, because the servers are usually hurrying back to the kitchen and don't check on you very much, but we did eat out here once.  I had the stuffed grape leaves, which were good but not outstanding, and the Greek fries, which lived up to all the hype.The hookah lounge itself has great ambience: red velvety swags of fabric on the walls, sultry-eyed portraits of harem maidens everywhere, plus ornamental hookahs and pretty chandeliers.  The seating consists of low, plush couches with big cushions, perfect for lounging indolently while you smoke.When you sit down, they'll present you with a tray of maybe fifteen different tobacco flavors in little tins.  I've enjoyed the apple, jasmine, and vanilla - banana was interesting, but weird.  Once you choose, they'll fill up your hookah, turn it on, and after a couple of minutes, it's ready to go.  The base lights up in an ever-changing rotation of colors, which is fun to look at, and each person gets an individual disposable plastic mouthpiece for the communal hookah pipe.One order of tobacco is good for about 30 minutes of smoke - you'll know your hookah is dead when you have to take a lung-busting inhale to get it to bubble.  If I recall correctly, it was about $15 for one sitting, so definitely take some pals to split the cost.  They're pretty good about not hassling you to leave, especially if you keep the drink orders coming, but they do have a last call (an alien concept for us Nevadans), so keep an eye on your watch.Between the crowds of customers and the bellydancing/techno background music, it can get fairly noisy here, and it's not a place to go for quiet conversation with an intimate date.  But as an exotic stop on a boozy night out, or a post-party chill session before heading home, everybody loves the hookah lounge, the hookah hookah hookah hookah lounge...",2,2,YAUHklfsbtmO3d48lS8QDw,7/24/2006,4,1,37,Restaurant

We ordered the appetizer combo ($14), which included hummus, olive tapenade, Carrot Delight, and a slightly spicy red pepper dip. For entrees, our group was evenly split between Turkish and Mediterranean. I loved my beef shish kebab, especially the flavorful rice, which sort of reminded me of dim sum sticky rice. The yogurt sauce was envied by my calzone-ordering tablemates, although they were very happy with their giant calzones. The house salad comes with a tangy lemony vinaigrette that's really good and worth trying.We came in fairly late, an hour before closing, when there was only one other table. Soon we were the only table, and from then on we were kind of obsessively stalked by our server, who was popping in every two minutes to refill the bread, ask if we needed anything else at all, and generally hurry us out the door. I didn't care for that part so much - if you're open till 9, you're open till 9. Quit bugging us about the damn bread.In addition to the shish kebab and some veggie Turkish dishes, there's also a sprinkling of traditional pasta dishes, a few salads, and individual pizzas. Prices ranged from $12-16 for dinner entrees, and it looked like they also did some pizza delivery or takeout at the counter.

Shoe lovers will find Adidas, Bass, Skechers, and Naturalizers, among others.  There are home furnishings stores (Mikasa, Black & Decker), leather stores (Wilson, and, soon, Coach), and gourmet foods (Harry & David, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory).  As with any ""outlet"" mall, there are some stores that seem suspiciously non-outlet, and some weird stores that are just oddball (like the rocks 'n' geodes shop).

It's usually slow, and the servers don't seem all that enthusiastic, and are sometimes hard to find.The food makes up for the depressing ambience, though.

Unbelievable I know, but it seems like a lot of work to open up your own restaurant and cook Khmer food so maybe it's the reason no one has opened up one in Chicago. Plus, I been working on compiling recipes from my mom to create my own family Khmer cookbook so I know about the work involved. I am part Cambodian and have been to Cambodia, and have a good idea of what good Khmer food tastes like and this place does an excellent job. The exterior made me feel like I was in a sketchy neighborhood, but the interior was simple and tastefully decorated to make you think that you are elsewhere. I am fascinated with seeing all the books on Cambodia. I was relieved to see that there was no karaoke Khmer music videos going on. That is so cliche for me and not even funny. The spring rolls are pretty good here. I had trouble deciding what to order since I was so familiar with all the items on there and it does cover quite a bit. One major thing that is missing is Prahok - this to me is one dishes that stand out from the other surrounding Southeast Asian country food dishes. I wouldn't mind seeing Sarai (coconut jello) and Bayng Janeau on the menu as well either - but that's just because I love that stuff, too. Had I been home at my parent's house, Katheaw is a Saturday lunch staple so I decided to have it here even though it was Friday dinner. It was very flavorful and maybe even better than the Katheaw I had in Cambodia. Well the portion is smaller than you would get ordering pho from a Vietnamese restaurant. In Cambodia I had to order 2 bowls to get full, so I think this might actually be the right amount. My only complaint was the price. My guess is that ingredients would be purchased from an Asian grocery store that other Southeast Asian Restaurant like Thai and Vietnamese Restaurant would also purchase items from. The prices would or should be on par with that. $3 a spring roll did make my eyebrows perk up a bit, where I think $2 might be more reasonable taking into account the size of the roll and all the ingredients. I've been getting creative with mine adding mangos and doing a brown rice wrapper so I can justify paying a premium for something that is a little more unique. Our server was friendly and helpful with recommendations. We did get a chance to speak a little Khmer. Of course, my face is going to get red from drinking - I'm Asian! Lol.

The back of the menu lists the many local farms that L'Etoile uses to produce its contemporary fine dining cuisine and the freshness and quality really come across.  A lot of their produce burst with flavor and freshness that is easy to find in California but difficult to find elsewhere.In addition to the fresh ingredients, L'Etoile utilizes a lot of premium ingredients like chanterelles, high quality prosciutto, buttery and velvety foie gras, and grass fed, dry aged beef. The kitchen also shows great versatility whether it is a fresh and vibrant salad like their tomato, cantaloupe, arugula, and prosciutto salad, an intense and refined fine dining dish like their foie gras with sweet corn, chanterelles and blueberry gastrique or a hearty Midwestern dish like their New York Strip with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and bearnaise.I enjoyed all the savory courses I had.  Their cantaloupe in their starter salad had a great sweetness and the aftertaste of that fruit was mellowed out.  In addition, the dish was one of the menu items utilizing Asian ingredients (the head chef Tory Miller has an Asian heritage).  The cantaloupe was marinated like kimchi to provided a nice spiciness.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#1Dm_XzeFUsGbh-7ea6UYpwThe seared foie gras was very good--buttery and creamy on the inside and a slightly crispy exterior.  All of the garnishes stood out--earthy chanterelles, very sweet summer corn and a sweet and tart blueberry gastrique.  I think the dish could have benefitted from brioche, a crumble or a streusel because of the creaminess of the dish.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#kZci-HIMA6X0QDqBEI8hxwThey do beef very well here.  They source from a farm that dry ages their beef. L'Etoile then performs additional dry aging.  With dry aging, you can make the meat more flavorful but which can sacrifice juiciness.  That was not the case here.  Despite being a New York Strip and being dry aged, the meat was very tender and juicy.The meat also had a really strong beef flavor, which you do not always get (even with good beef).  The outside crust was also good--slightly crisp and very flavorful.  The side of mashed potatoes was also very good--rich and very thick (like good French pomme purxc3xa9e).  The other sides (like overcooked shiitake mushrooms) were very ordinary--the kind of food you would get at a run of the mill steakhouse.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#X9QeW2cMEXDG8iUldS1h1QFor cheeses, they feature 30 varieties of cheese from Wisconsin.  I did not love the cow's milk cheese I had, but it was more because it was not my kind of cheese.  I like softer and creamier cheeses.  The cheese did have a complex flavor--nutty like gouda but also with salty Parmesan notes.  The garnishes were great--really flavorful and crisp walnut toast, spicy hazelnuts and a really good fruit paste of cherries and berries.For dessert, I had their warm polenta cake with blueberry compote.  The cake was good as was the blueberry topping.  The garnishes did not work though.  I liked the caramel corn but the regular corn (not treated in any way to produce a different texture) just did not work as a dessert. The sour cream and blueberry sorbet was icy and tart.  And given that the polenta cake was not incredibly sweet or rich, I think a good ice cream would have been the better way to go.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#VYKnzdgfn2KDV7hMZcgsgQService was excellent.  My server Jessica was very personable, polite and polished.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu, which made me very confident on what I was ordering.  Despite the many courses, the food came out at a very even pace.Prices are high at L'Etoile, but the quality is very good and portions on several items are very generous.L'Etoile occupies a very nice space. The room is elegant but also contemporary and the huge windows allow a lot of great natural light to fill the room as well as allow patrons to view Madison's picturesque and lively capital square.I have not dined at many Restaurant in Wisconsin, but I would imagine that L'Etoile has to be one of the very best.  It is one of the best Midwestern Restaurant I have been to outside of Chicago.  With its focus on local farms, Wisconsin cheese, high quality beef, and contemporary cooking techniques/styles, L'Etoile is a great restaurant to experience cuisine that reflects both the chef's formal training at great Restaurant as well as the high quality food that the midwest has to offer.Parking via pay lots/structures is available.",20,15,PalFBSjGAhs73L2UO31QxQ,11/28/2013,5,11,153,Restaurant

There is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several Prime steaks.  There is also a seasonal MIX tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of Alain Ducasse signature dishes.  I decided to opt for the Alain Ducasse tasting menu.(Sweet corn soup amuse) The sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.(Assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) The breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  The addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.(Potato gnocchi, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) The gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and I prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  The asparagus was good.  The mushrooms were just okay, but I really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).(Seared foie gras, date puree, lemon confit) I added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty foie gras.  The foie gras was not that good though.  It was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.(Roasted Maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) The lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining Restaurant. The coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  It just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  And because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).(Filet mignon rossini, foie gras, black truffle) This was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  The filet was decent.  It was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but I did not think the quality of the meat was great.  The foie gras was similar to the a la carte foie gras where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great foie gras (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).The black truffle was not that great either.  It was probably Australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  This truffle part might be better in the winter.(Mango puree) The first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  It was mango puree and a soda foam.  It was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.(Baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) This was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  The sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  As individual parts, this dessert was decent, but I did not really love it as a whole.(Madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  I liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  I wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  The chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.Despite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.Prices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  And because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.I thought the service at MIX was very good, but the food was about the same quality as Mandalay Bay's other lackluster fine dining spot Aureole.  There is a lot mediocre fine dining in Las Vegas and, unfortunately, Alain Ducasse's MIX falls in that bunch.  If you are looking for better and more contemporary French dining, you should check out L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand instead.The Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking.",18,14,e2kvliweB-E2VEs2_8YhJg,9/22/2012,2,9,143,Restaurant

The flavors range from traditional flavors like dark chocolate and vanilla bean to more unique flavors like Bangkok peanut, mango lassi and whiskey with pecans.The wide variety of flavors is an immediate draw as is the location; similar to Sweet Rose in Brentwood, Jeni's is located in a quaint and idyllic area (a charming little town called Chagrin Falls).  Jeni's has a great decor.  It is very contemporary and the menu is displayed on a chalkboard like so many good Restaurant, bakeries and ice cream shops.  There is also a nice seating area.Another inviting element about Jeni's is the use of local product--not just the dairy but key ingredients for several of the flavors (such as Ohio blackberries, raspberries, honey, peppermint, and whiskey).All of the above are great reasons to try Jeni's, but for me, ice cream always comes down to the consistency and how distinct the flavors are.  The consistency at Jeni's is great--up there with the best I've had in terms of ice cream shops.  The ice cream is firm and dense but also smooth and creamy (there is also no trace of iciness).The flavors at Jeni's are distinct, but given the wide variety of flavors, some flavors definitely shine more than others.  The salty caramel is good.  It has the burnt caramel flavor you would get at Bi-Rite Creamy, but it also has kind of a molasses note.  The Ugandan vanilla bean is great--classic and refreshing.  I also really liked the backyard peppermint flavor; the mint flavor was a lot cooler than standard mint flavors, but the good thing here was that it did not become an off putting peppermint candy like flavor you often see during the holiday season.The brambleberry crisp was great.  It had great fruit notes from the blackberries and raspberries, but the Ugandan vanilla base kept it from becoming too tart like a lot of fruit ice creams.  The toasted oat streusel provided a nice crispy texture.The brown butter almond brittle was great--great sweet flavor and brittle that was just right (too often, ice cream places use a cheap brittle that is sandy and overly sugary).  And the roasted strawberry flavor had a truly different strawberry flavor from the roasting process.  Kind of like roasted peppers in a soup, the roasted strawberries made a difference here.The Queen City Cayenne was easily the best of the chocolate flavors I tried.  I find a lot of spicy chocolate flavors to be dry and the spiciness is too upfront and abrasive, which kind of makes the chocolate flavor an afterthought.  With Jeni's version though you get the nice sweet chocolate flavor and the spiciness from the cayenne and cinnamon sneaks up on you, but it lasts (a truly spicy flavor).  The other chocolate flavors (like the milk chocolate and dark chocolate) were fine but nothing that would stand out when compared to great ice cream spots like Bi-Rite Creamery, Carmela and Sweet Rose Creamery.The pistachio and honey was good, but the pistachio flavor was mild; I prefer the stronger pistachio flavor you get at Bulgarini.  Pistachios are also featured in the white house cherry ice cream, which is a great chunky ice cream (small enough ingredients to make it easy to eat but still noticeable flavors); the softness of the pistachios is a letdown even if it is unavoidable.  The whiskey and pecans flavor did not have that nice punch you get with some of the stout ice creams I've had at Carmela and fine dining Restaurant.  With the Bangkok peanut, you get the peanut as well as the coconut and the spice (I'm not sure if I would think pad thai with this ice cream though).Jeni's also features upscale ice cream desserts and sundaes.  Their Swiss roll is great combining vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate cake, a thin yet strong cherry sauce and fresh whipped cream.  The dessert is like a great modern reinterpretation of the black forest cake.Service is great.  They have a lot of staff so big crowds are handled easily and quickly.  The staff is pleasant, friendly, polite, and professional.While the quality is great, prices are high.  Prices are similar to what you would pay at Carmela and Sweet Rose Creamery (which are both a little more expensive than Bi-Rite Creamery).Jeni's is an exceptional ice cream spot.  They have other locations in Columbus (the original location) as well as Nashville.  The great creamy consistency coupled with the distinct and refreshing flavors make Jeni's a must visit if you are in this part of Ohio.Free street parking is available.",18,19,Em0XtU-mwmO9SIf6d2CoJw,6/24/2012,5,15,140,Restaurant

It sits right in Downtown Cleveland.  The restaurant has a lively bar and the dining room fills up quickly (even on a weeknight).  The atmosphere is nice though I prefer a less dark dining room.  Still, I like the vibe that the bustling open kitchen creates and the bar is really nicely done--very high end look with wine bottles attractively displayed.Symon's cuisine is upscale rustic.  It is not quite gastropub fare; it is more like fine dining fare with less artsy plating and a mix of premium but also less expensive ingredients (like beef cheek and hanger steak).The fine dining but still robust and approachable food did remind me a little of Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I've been to Mesa Grill and I've enjoyed it.  The food there does seem to be on autopilot though; the dishes they serve and the presentations feel like the restaurant has found its groove and is just coasting now.Lola feels much more of the moment.  There is definitely a lot of signature dishes, but there also seems to be enough use of seasonal ingredients throughout the menu to keep the food feeling fresh (the presentations feel more organic and not overly precise like Mesa Grill).The bread at Lola was standard stuff.  Even though the crust was actually good and chewy, the center was really soft (kind of like the bread you would get from a grocery store bakery) - 2 stars.The starters were good though.  The crispy sweetbreads were nicely cooked.  I prefer bigger sweetbreads and less breading, but I think they did a good job achieving a crispy outside and a juicy and meaty inside.  I really liked the garnishes with the sweetbreads.  The cauliflower puree was great--very smooth and with a noticeable cauliflower flavor but not bitter or bland like a lot of cauliflower purees.I also liked the crunchy pine nuts as well as the tart green apple and sweet raisins (4 stars).The beef cheek pierogi were also good.  The beef cheek filling was flavorful, moist and meaty.  The pierogi had a thick outside pasta shell that was more like an empanada than ravioli.  It was thick and kind of like pastry crust (which was interesting).The garnishes were great.  I liked the rich pan jus as well as the very noticeable but not too strong horseradish crxc3xa8me fraiche.  The wild mushrooms were also very good - 4 stars.For my entrxc3xa9e, I opted for the scallops though I did regret not trying their pork chop with polenta.  The scallops were still good.  They had a great crust and were very moist and soft.  There was a little unevenness with the seasoning.  The two center scallops were perfectly seasoned while the one on the left had a little too much salt while the one on the left was touched with too much lemon.Like the sweetbreads, the garnishes were great.  They did a lot with asparagus here.  They had sautxc3xa9ed green asparagus as well as ribbons of white asparagus and creamy and light white asparagus puree (really good).  There was good freshness provided by pea tendrils and fava beans.  There was also a nice smoky and meaty flavor from bacon (4 stars).For dessert, I went with their brioche French toast, which was served with maple bacon ice cream and caramelized apples.  The French toast was great.  They added a great batter to the French toast, which gave it a more defined crispy crust than most French toast.  It also had a moist and flavorful center.I really liked the caramelized apples.  They used green apple and the tart apple kept the dessert from being too sweet.  The maple bacon ice cream was very creamy and smooth.  It was lightly sweet and there was a good amount of chewy bacon (the maple flavor was not that noticeable though) - 4 stars.There was also a complimentary almond macaroon cookie, which had great almond and coconut flavors.Service by Meghan was very good.  She was personable and professional.  She was also knowledgeable about the menu and attentive.  The food came out at a good and consistent pace between all courses.Prices were about what you would expect but still on the high side with most of the entrees in the high $20s.I really enjoyed Lola and it was significantly above the other Restaurant I tried in Cleveland.  If it was in LA, I think I would still say it was a good to very good restaurant though maybe not my favorite restaurant.  Still, I think it is a very strong restaurant for the Cleveland area.  While I haven't been to many Restaurant in Cleveland, I think if you were only going to one Cleveland restaurant, Lola would have to be very high on your list.Because Lola is located in Downtown Cleveland, nearby parking is very expensive (there are several lots and structures nearby).",24,20,JAWCcHRFdEhygHKAIiTEng,7/1/2012,5,18,136,Restaurant

This one is an upscale spot next to the John Heinz History Center.  The restaurant has a nice contemporary decor.  There is a slightly open kitchen.  The main dining room makes a good use of green and there is comfortable seating along with white tablecloth.  The room also has high ceilings.  In some ways, the room reminds me a little of a cross between Tavern and Lucques (though Eleven lacks the inside-and-outside like atmosphere of Tavern).Eleven's lunch menu is very inviting.  There is a great collection of starters--some nice sounding salads but also scallops and crab cakes.  Their entree section features a mix of gourmet sandwiches and burgers as well as plates with proteins like lamb and fish.The bread at Eleven was standard stuff--not much of a crust, not much of a chew and even a little bit dry.My starter was good.  I had the seared scallops, which were garnished with fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, spinach, sorrel, and sauce gribiche.  It was a very generous portion for a lunch starter.  I thought it was good.  Everything tasted fine and a lot of the ingredients were good.The scallops were nicely seasoned and had a good outside crust.  They were tender, but the scallops lacked the moistness of the scallops at Lola.  I liked the pearl onions and I thought the sauce gribiche was briny, sour and good.  I also liked the spinach.The fingerling potatoes were too big.  They were not bland and definitely not raw, but the insides of the potatoes were not as tender as they should have been (4 stars for this dish).For my entree, I had the Elysian Fields Farm lamb t-bones with a salad of radicchio, arugula, endive, fingerling potatoes, and idiazabal cheese.  Elysian Fields Farm is a great producer of lamb (the farm is located just an hour outside of Pittsburgh).  I once had their lamb at Sona and it was exceptional there (they also provide lamb to The French Laundry).The lamb here was good.  The lamb was like little porterhouse steaks.  There was a New York strip part that was flavorful and juicy but also with a chew and less tender texture than the filet mignon-like portion, which was very tender.There were two t-bones and they were a tad uneven.  One was seasoned a little too heavily while the other was not as juicy as I wanted.  Still, the lamb t-bones were flavorful and good.The salad was a very bitter salad with the radicchio, arugula and fennel.  I did not mind the bitterness, but I think some would.  I liked the cheese and they did a better job with the fingerling potatoes here, which were sliced and tender (3 stars for this entree).For dessert, I had the chocolate-peanut pretzel candy bar, which was surprisingly  good.  The base of the candy bar was a decent though not great brownie.  There was a very good and creamy peanut butter mousse as well as a thin layer of a dark chocolate bar.  There was a decent chocolate ice cream on top as well as peanut brittle and very good pretzel nuggets that were topped with smooth melted chocolate.There was also a caramel sauce.  The dessert tasted pretty good and while there were a lot of sweet and rich elements, the dessert did not get too rich or too sweet (4 stars for this dessert).The meal ended with a coconut macaroon, which was mediocre and dry.Service was good.  My server was pleasant, personable, polite, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.Prices were about what you would expect to pay for an upscale lunch.  When considering the many high quality and premium ingredients used, this lunch at Eleven was probably a little less expensive than equivalent places in LA.I liked my lunch at Eleven.  While the food was not exceptional, my starter, entree and dessert were all at the very least good.  The food was not really creative or exciting enough to make me want to come back, but I think this is a good option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh (they had a pretty good lunch crowd on the day I went).There are several metered spots along Smallman Street.

The restaurant has a simple cafxc3xa9-like dxc3xa9cor, but there are great touches.  I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures--rustic but also trendy.  The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it.Their lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines.  There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai-like dish and a banh mi.  I went for one of their modern Asian entrees, which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed, cucumber, surimi, and mushrooms.  It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon.The salmon entrxc3xa9e seemed like something you would find at a run-of-the-mill Asian fusion restaurant, but it was so much better than that.  The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it.  The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist, but it still flaked very easily.  I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce.The garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool, refreshing and flavorful.  I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad.  It was a very light dish, but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish.If I were going to nitpick, I would say that the entrxc3xa9e seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it.  But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well, it is hard to complain (5 stars).I also tried their flatbread, which was topped with cheese, grilled artichokes, prosciutto, and arugula.  This flatbread had a great crust, which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong.  It had a great flavor with the right amount of char; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew.The arugula was great--leafy, peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread).  The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto, but the prosciutto was good (not dry, meaty and with the right amount of saltiness).The cheese was good too.  In terms of other toppings, they used the woody part of the artichoke, which wouldn't be my first choice, but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars).For dessert, I went with their blondie, which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple.  The bruleed green apple was great.  It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple).  I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great.That candy apple-like taste made from a technique you often see with crxc3xa8me brulee was kind of eye opening.  And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel, it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time.The pretzel buttercream was good.  You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor.  What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars).I also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great--great flavor, smooth, creamy, dense, and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars.Service by Lauren was great.  She was personable, nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.  The food also came out at a good pace.Prices for lunch were reasonable.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-$15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below.Avenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations.  There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared.  All these great things plus Avenue B's reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh.Parking is available on the street by meter.  It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime.",23,20,WKwTnzvDvtXR0u9daU1Nng,6/27/2012,5,17,130,Restaurant

I prefer Kabuto due to its more minimalist dxc3xa9cor and sushi focus. Kabuto offers an omakase, and their Kabuto omakase serves guests a variety of courses to accompany their sushi omakase.The Kabuto omakase started with a really good lime sake, which was lightly sweet and refreshing. Next came a really good amuse course. There was very good Bluefin tuna that was marinated in soy and seaweed to give it both a salty and ocean-like flavor; it was garnished with crisp daikon and wakame. The amuse also came with tender octopus topped with julienned radish and sitting in a broth of dashi and really good and slimy seaweed I have only experienced in Japan.Next up was their sashimi course, and this is definitely where Kabuto did not quite measure up to top Japanese sushi Restaurant on the west coast. Both the yellowtail and snapper were not that moist and did not glisten like great sushi. The scallop though was very good, and I liked the Washington state oyster topped with ponzu. The raw sweet shrimp was also good, and I enjoyed the distinct nori paste to accompany the snapper.The grilled plate followed, and I really enjoyed it. The preparations were very Japanese. The chef utilized fish choices that you would find in Restaurant throughout Japan even though they did not reveal the incredible moistness and flakiness of premium fish choices like black cod found at other high-end U.S. based Japanese Restaurant (like Nobu).Several of the fish courses had great garnishes. The meaty yellowtail was topped with a bruleed miso sauce while the ocean trout was finished with a sweet and creamy uni sauce. The seared tuna was cooked too much for my taste and was topped with a soy marinated grated daikon. There was also a quite bitter snail bite and Alaskan snow crab with mushrooms.The nigiri courses came next. Some were exceptional while others tasted lackluster compared to the best sushi you would find in the country. Still, there was mostly excellent to very good sushi here. I really liked the silky fatty tuna, which combined the more lean texture of Bluefin tuna with the richness and creaminess of toro. Also very enjoyable was the black snapper brushed with lemon and topped with sea salt and yuzu zest. The hair tail was really good and had similarities to barracuda and mackerel. There was also creamy and sweet Chilean uni and a little bowl of rice and bursting with saltiness and ocean flavor salmon roe. Other nigiri with their omakase included Bluefin tuna (good not great), marbled fatty tuna (good), kohada, and baby yellowtail. There was also a very sweet egg omelet.I ordered several additional nigiri, and there were some true standouts. I really enjoyed the barracuda. It was nicely seared to give a slight crispiness to the outside as well as make the fish even more moist (great melting of fatty and oily fish). They had 2 additional uni offerings, and I tried both. The Hokkaido uni had a stronger ocean flavor than their omakase uni, and there was also a sweet, very creamy and delicious uni from Santa Barbara.There was also a nice golden eel nigiri (very soft) as well as two kinds of ocean trout--the more standard piece and a rich and creamy ocean trout belly. The omakase also featured a toro hand roll and a very good though a little too hot in temperature miso soup. The omakase also came with dessert, and I opted for the strawberry crepes cake, which was satisfying though not remarkable.Service was exceptional--very personable, professional, polished and polite. Prices on their a la carte menu are definitely high. I thought their omakase was reasonable though compared to both omakase Restaurant in Los Angeles and tasting menu Restaurant in Las Vegas.Kabuto is a very good Japanese restaurant and one of the best Restaurant in Las Vegas. Some of their fish (like their premium toro) may not match up to top sushi Restaurant in the country like Nozawa Bar, Sushi Zo or Q Sushi in Los Angeles. That being said, some of their sushi is exceptional and reveals the kind of moisture and flavor that truly elevates this sushi from more standard though still good west coast sushi Restaurant. With the skill in the kitchen, the excellent fish and the inclusion of hard to find Japanese ingredients, Kabuto is a restaurant not to be missed regardless of how long your stay is in Las Vegas.Kabuto is located in a dining plaza with very limited parking.

We arrived on time for our reservation. There were 5 of us so when the host showed us to our seat, imagine my surprise when the table had only been set for 4. We stood awkwardly around until the host grabbed a chair from a nearby table and we all moved around to make room. Eventually a bus boy also grabbed a place setting from a nearby table. We were not off to a good start. This should never happen in a fine dining restaurant. Once we got settled with drinks in hand, a server brought out three kinds of fries with three sauces as a little appetizer for the table. Quite tasty and much appreciated as we were all starving. The sommelier, Aaron, was quite good. We told him what our favorite wine was, and while they didn't carry it, he did find another Cabernet that was very good and actually made it on my list to have again. The menu is set up with a cold shellfish section, first courses, specialties of the house and a more typical steakhouse menu with a range of steaks and sides. We chose from each with some wins and losses along the way. The wins? The fresh oysters that change daily, the heirloom tomato and burrata salad, and the wedge salad were some of the best starters. For entrees- you can't go wrong with any of the steaks. All were perfectly prepared and the specialty lamb chops were also good. The absolute best thing that we ordered was the lobster pot pie with truffle cream. This comes out in a copper baking pot with the crust on. They cut the crust off, placing it on your plate and then proceed to spoon the lobster and vegetables on top of it. Absolutely amazing! On a side note -if you like lobster- don't order the poached lobster. It was way over cooked and so tough that we could not get a knife through it. They did end up taking this off of our bill, but again- surprising for a restaurant of this caliber to so over cook something. And a couple of the sides ended up disappointing as well. The asparagus was thick and a weird flavor from the olives and herbs surrounding it. And the hash brown cakes? Dry with the only flavor coming from the bacon that was on top of it. But save room for dessert (in fact- this is so good you might just want to start with it) They have in house made beignets with three kinds of dipping sauce. Forget the chocolate and creme brulee dip. Only order the 18 year old real scotch butter scotch pudding dip. Absolutely the most amazing flavor! It makes any other pudding seem like, well secondary. Service was efficient but not overly friendly. The bus boy was actually more helpful and pleasant and it was nice to hear him talk about the career path that this restaurant has for their employees. Know before you go that this is not a cheap date. Dinner with wine and tip for 5 ran almost $700. For that kind of money, I really expected more than I got thus the lower rating. A-OK sums it up perfectly. It was fine but I just don't think this will go on my list to tell people to check out.",2,1,CkAfFc9UvtaYxJYgr50AWA,9/20/2010,3,1,64,Restaurant

It's store front simplicity must surprise a lot of people as the night we were there- there were no less than 5 tables that got seated, looked at the menu, apologized and then walked out.  It's my belief that the name ""Harvest"" makes people think its some type of an organic sandwich shop when instead it is a white table cloth dining experience with a menu that includes a 6 course ""tasting"" paired with wines or a more traditional menu.The food is good.  The chef sent out a ""muse"" of lettuce soup.  Yep- I said lettuce and that is what is tasted like.  Wasn't crazy about it, but half the fun of eating out is trying new things.  We ordered a variety of first courses from the tuna tartar (very good) to the duck prosciutto (good) to the Caesar wrap (not so good, yet it was the server's recommendation- very strange)  The Caesar wrap was like  small bits of rolled pastry around lettuce served with an anchovy on top and some sauce.  Not the best thing on the menu.The main courses were very good.  We had the halibut, the hamachi (covered in foam and served with fava beans) and the crawfish lasagna made with spinach noodles.  For dessert we split the berry crumble (very sour) but good.As for the service- it was nonexistent.  In fact- I might suggest that our server get a new career for herself.  She was unpersonable, didn't know the menu and seemed to always be a beat off.  We got more help from the busgirl who seemed very eager to help us out.  Very strange for a restaurant of that caliber.Reasonably priced (at least by Chicago standards) the 6 course tasting menu was only $55 and the accompanying wines were another $25.  On the regular menu, the average entree was about $25.So, bottom line?  It was good food, served in a very nice downtown location.  As for the service- if they get that right- I might give it another star.",0,0,Zr7EpNDDOth-cVDOrGXoJg,6/8/2007,3,0,54,Restaurant

Oh yeah, I'm in the mood for a good workout and decided to walk around one of Arizona's huge outlet malls. Of all the malls/outlets I've visited, I actually like the Arizona Mills mall. The outlet is obviously much bigger than the Petaluma Outlet Mall. Much more colorful than the one in Gilroy. And despite me being here on a weekday around noon, this nicely-architect outlet is much more livelier than the Great Mall in Milpitas with more and better shops to get lost in.In the mall, there are six different entry ways. Automatically you can tell this outlet is big and already a workout. Each entry way has a sensor of a voice-recording of a man welcoming you to the mall. Sounds creepy, huh?The anchor businesses of the mall are Sport's Authority, Ross, Burlington, Marshall's, Sak's, Neiman Marcus, & Sears Appliance outlet. The anchor Restaurant are Johnny Rocket's, Joe's Crab, El Pollo loco and Claim Jumper. I wish I knew about Claim Jumper prior and before my breakfast beforehand.  And for your entertainment, there are an arcade center and AMC theaters with also IMAX-screeningThere are a ton of retail businesses from this mall. And some of the places I've saw and shopped are Border's Discount, Sanrio, Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Oakley, Vans, Crocs, Samsonite, Aeropostale, Animal Kingdom, Levi's, Pink, Radio Shack, Charlotte Russe, F21, Eddie Bauer, Guess, Bebe, Disney Store, Tommy Hilfiger, Victoria Secret, Spencer's, Izod, Sunglasses Hut, Reebok and Nike Outlet Store (obviously, I went and shopped here). That is only a fraction of the mall I saw and shopped. Guess, I'm getting old and can't walk around outlet as big as here no more. But wait there is the food court with a Sbarro, Starbucks, Paradise Bakery, Nathan's Hot Dog, BK, Panda Express, Hana Grill, and Subway. And for a cool treat to beat the desert heat, there is also a Yo-Yo's Frozen Yogurt place (I'll review later).

It arrived with large scrapes and scratches on it. I emailed (with photo attached) to complain and was completely dismissed and  told "". This is a natural quality of the material and design in order to give it a ""vintage"" look - it will naturally wear in as the bag ages."" Let me tell you that was over 7 months ago and the scratches and scrapes are still as visible as the day it arrived and there is nothing natural looking about it. I was too annoyed to make an exchange as it took over a month just to get the purse in the first place. I will never order from them again.

I've been a devotee for several years now. My initial reason for shopping the brand was because they made vegan handbags and accessories. Then upon further research I found that these guys not only spare our furry friends, they also save the planet. Who wouldn't want to support a company doing so much?!!Their purses look like leather but they are 100% vegan and their lining is made of recycled material. I get compliments all the time and when I tell people it's not real leather they always want to touch my purse (I'm glad they're so interested but I'm not a fan of foreign hands on my goods). I typically shop directly from their site but a few boutiques around town carry their line. The website gives plenty of visuals and detail so I'm always happy with the actual product matching my expectations.Behind this fantastic brand is a great group of employees. I recently lost a tiny decorative screw to one of the purses I carry often. I emailed customer service, let them know what my issue was and I got a response the same day. They asked me to send them a couple of images for reference and then they sent out multiple options and a hand written note.Everything worked out perfectly and I appreciated their attention to detail. Since I've owned the purse for a couple of years now, I never would have thought they'd be so willing to help. But these guys really want you to be happy. And as a result, I just had to buy a couple more purses (but I digress).So I have no problem promoting a company that does so much for their customers and the planet.

They said that they auto ship from Canada when there isn't stock in the NY warehouse, and made NO attempts to compensate me for this extra fee that I didn't know about in advance.

It never says ""this may ship to you in a fashion that requires you to pony up the fee that *most* companies pay, themselves to ship"".

I've been refilling my own inkjet and toner cartridges for decades. In the past 5 years it seams that the quality and consistency of 3rd party ink has gone from a joke to superior than OEM. It's also been difficult in the past to find a ink vendor that takes aim at a good price/quality balance. There are several older high end ink sellers who set their price point just below OEM ink, InkOwl costs less than 50% of OEM prices. I own several Epson wide format printers. I'm using InkOwl ink in an R800, R1800 and Pro 4000. So far the results are excellent on plain paper, a couple types of thick fine art paper and canvas. I've superficially measured color, their UltraChrome Hi-gloss shows a wider blue range than OEM and not quite as dense blacks. I haven't measured their UltraChrome K2 (it looks adequate). I'm happy enough to plan to start using InkOwl for all my refilling. I've purchased one set of (8) refillable cartridges, one had a bad chip and was replaced rapidly after one email. Their prices are competitive, their customer service is good and I'm very happy with the print quality.As a general note to those considering refillable cartridges vs a CISS... I recommend a 3rd option: Buy a printer that can use at least 50ml ink tanks (instead of the common 15ml or less) and get a couple sets of refillables.Oh ya and like the guys before me said refilling can be messy. For toner wear a mask and clean with a damp rag (not a vacuum). For ink be near a sink, have a bottle of glass cleaner with ammonia, a lot of rags and clean any stray ink immediately.",6,0,BQwf3XkQLPGYcQcFo8ruqg,11/1/2013,5,0,38,Shopping

They were very accommodating and the trial was very inexpensive.  $22 for two weeks.  This is a fairly large facility, with two pools, a full size gym for basketball, etc..  a small aerobics studio, and a cardio equipment room with approximately 15 elliptical machines, 20 treadmills, 10 bikes (aside from bikes reserved for spin classes), a couple of rowing machines, a variety of Freemotion resistance machines, a free weight area, etc.   There is also plenty of parking and a day care center.   The cardio and resistance machines are mostly new and state of the art and they all face a row of several tv's that are mounted in the middle of the room.  Each is tuned to a major station, (CNN, ESPN, ABC, etc)  has closed captioning, and there is a place to plug your headphones in on each machine - though I did not see if it actually worked.I do wish they would ban the use of cell phones during your workout.  We do this at many, many gyms in the Silicon Valley and it really cuts down on the annoyance factor.   I'm here to get away from business and other issues and have some ""me time"" in order to clear my head and to focus on my health.  You, Jabberjaws, should be doing the same.Other than that, there is a 60 min time limit on machines, and disinfectant spray with paper towels to clean the machines after use.    Great.  Though washable hand towels may be more ecologically sound. I chose this gym because of the abundance of classes, including the ones I take at my gym at home - which are Zumba and the Les Mills classes (Bodypump, Bodycombat, etc).    They also offer Yoga, Pilates, Spinning and a variety of other classes.I took the Bodypump class and it was fine in that you know what to expect because Les Mills classes are a franchise type deal - so the choreography is always the same.  However, I was disappointed that the class was held in the Gym.   Due to the high gym ceilings it was very echo-y and difficult to hear the instructor and the music.  In addition, half of the gym was curtained off and people were playing basketball on the other side.  The noise was very distracting on top of the poor acoustics and made it even more difficult to hear.   The equipment was also pretty run down - but useable.   I understand that the facility is run by the city so one thing at a time, I suppose.The instructor was good but not great.  I have *alot* of experience with fitness classes and am a professional dancer.   I can safely say that her counts and cues were slightly off... particularly compared to other instructors I have experience with.  But , she was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. I also took the Tuesday night Zumba class and the instructor was a substitute during Xmas.   She was good but not great.  She did not follow through on movements (ie: no extension in her arms and her steps were shortened) and her rhythm was slightly off.   But she was very nice and encouraging and she knew her routines well.  I have been taking Zumba for over two years now, with several different instructors back home, and I am used to mostly VERY difficult workouts. This was not particularly hard for me, but YMMV.   If you are experienced at all with Zumba or other aerobics classes, you'll likely know how make it harder on yourself, if needed.  I never did make it to the BodyCombat class, so I can't say how that compares but I would encourage anyone to try it.  It's generally an easy to follow cardio-kickboxing class that can be modified for all levels.  When I return next year for the holidays I will likely join this gym again.   Overall, it was helpful to keep me on track with the battle of the Xmas bulge.",4,1,AGc9FADari4jsMxl9oU-fw,12/22/2009,3,4,29,Shopping

I'd always wanted to try the product, yet couldn't justify spending $24 on 16 oz. of bath salts (the price has since increased to $30).  The jar was part of a gift package, but Aveda really doesn't offer discounts on its products.  However, I do appreciate that I'm able to customize gift assortments to include specific products I know the person I'm gifting is particular fond of!  [If you''re ever stumped on what to get someone for the holidays, a birthday, or any other special occasion, try your luck at any Aveda location-- all the women I know love Aveda products (some say they don't, but secretly do and just hate having to pay premium prices for them!).  You say ""But what if the person I'm gifting is a guy?""  Well, I'm going to let you in on a secret-- guys LOVE Aveda-pampering, too!  I know, bec. I've bought hair products, mint soaps, and after shaves from here, and even the most-macho guys grin from ear-to-ear when they find themselves the lucky recipients!  LOL]Anyhoo, back to that jar of soothing salts I was talking about... I've been rationing my usage of the salts for special occasions, such as when I run out of detoxifying generic Epsom salts*, or when my stash of Aura Cacia Pure Aromatherapy Foam Bath sampler pack doesn't particularly appeal to me at the time.  I am saddened to think that after tonight's wonderful bath, I only have enough for one more blissful soak :(  I know where I could get a brand-new jar for future baths, but some things in life are just more satisfying when they're gifted, don't you agree?  Hmm... Valentine's Day is just around the corner...I wish I could give this particular location 5 stars, but based on the last few visits (once or twice a year), I really can't, as the prior excellent level of customer service I'd received has considerably depreciated.  Gone are the enthusiastic, yet warm greetings, and rarely, if at all, am I greeted w/ a hot cup of licorice-mint tea, anymore.  But I still love the products, even though I almost-always now get them at Tempe's Moodswings salon...*Helpful tip:  Epsom salt baths are great after getting massages; a soak helps to significantly mitigate soreness you may sometimes experience after an intense session by reducing inflammation.  I know, bec. I used to say ""OK/alright"" when my ex-therapist would suggest a soak until I finally did one day, and wouldn't you know it, it really did help!  I now almost never go w/out a soak after a session, even if hours may go by before I get the chance!)",9,8,0UGVuvStyGuDJP2Ez3UnJQ,1/24/2011,4,6,66,Shopping

I've also tried looking for specialty ice cream before, such as Three Twins organic (not sold here), or specific flavors of Ben & Jerry's, but I always talk myself out of buying any.  I decided to forgo dining at Postino's today- I've been craving a bruschetta board for ages, but didn't feel like socializing, so instead went to Fry's to see if I could locate some fig jam and a cheese, or two.  Lo, I was very pleasantly surprised to leave with so much more!After missing out on a great parking spot, thinking I'd spotted an even better one (nope, it was a deeply recessed space for carts!- they need to put up better signage for this), I had to settle for a ""15-min only"" spot.  Good!  I have another reason to keep this short and sweet.

FYI, I love almost anything coffee-flavored!  Verdict?  Yes, and yes!  Note to self: must pick these flavors up after raiding the cheese counter.And oh, what a cheese counter it was!  I was in the vicinity of gourmet edibles (imported butters, pickled jars of peppers, bags of veggie and pita chips) when a woman asked if she could offer any assistance-- yes, please!  Do you sell any fig jam?  And she said to follow her to what I'd like to call a slice of cheese heaven!  After pointing out the fig and other fruit pastes, as well as the jars of Dalmatia Fig Spread (I've bought these before from Whole Foods; they're good), I thought I'd investigate a little further, even though I didn't have much time... I only had 15 minutes!  On top of the counter, on one side, are packets of chocolates.  Cute packaging, $5 each: Hazelnut, Dark chocolate, Salted Caramel, and something else.  Can't recall if any of them were fair trade, but I'm not looking for chocolates, I need something fruity!  Oh, yes!  There you are... Harvest Song.  100% Natural Apricot Artisan Preserves.  Gold Award winner?  Gluten-free?  All that mattered to me were ""100% Natural, No Pectin, NO PRESERVATIVES, and Pure cane sugar.""  (!!!)  I recommend this product 1000 times!  Sure, the Dalmatia fig spread is OK, but this apricot preserves is life-changing!  Especially when paired with Murray's triple creme Brie.  Found this brie wedge under ""Buttery"" after first checking out all of the sections and then noticing the signs above that posted descriptions of the cheeses.  I also chose a slab of Murray's Butter Kase, but that'll have to wait for another time.  My delicious late lunch consisted of a little bit of seasoned fried pork chop, four peppadews (from Sprout's), and two slices of Dave's Killer Breads 100% Honey Whole Wheat (from Whole Foods), toasted, upon which I buttered some of the triple creme Brie that I first wrapped up in foil and heated in the toaster oven, and THEN topped with the apricot preserves.  HEAVEN!  I only meant to have one slice of bread, but these preserves were so fantastic, I went ahead and toasted another slice...  **http://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/forgotten-flavors-we-lovep.s.

(I left before 6p, so perhaps the celebration continued after 6p.)  While I was there, I tried cupcakes by Cake Contessa and slices of cakes by Tracey Dempsey, Phoenix Public Market Cafe, and Bread Basket.  It was so hard to pick a favorite, as each had something more special than the others.  Honest!  Here are participants' offerings (well, at least what I was able to try!)--CAKE CONTESSA: Vanilla and chocolate cupcakes w/ vanilla frosting-Both cupcakes were melt-in-your-mouth tender.  Out of the two, my fave was the vanilla!TRACY DEMPSEY: Coffee-marmalade cake- White cake w/ orange marmalade-vanilla icing layer in the middle and coffee frosting.  Loved the texture of this cake, which was more like a pound cake), and I also liked the orange and coffee combo.PHOENIX PUBLIC MARKET CAFE: Chocolate cake AND Vegan chocolate cake-Yellow cake w/ chocolate frosting on top and middle layers, as well as a dark chocolate ganache atop a vanilla fondant layer!  Loved this cake's texture, which was a little denser than that of Tracy's, and the combo of the its texture and fondant/ganache was new to me.  I've had cakes w/ a fondant topping, and I've had cakes frosted w/ ganache, but not one w/ both!  Out of all the cakes I sampled, CC's simple vanilla cupcake and PPMC's ganache-topped yellow cake topped my list UNTIL someone brought out the...Vegan chocolate cake- Eggless chocolate cake w/ raspberry jam doubling as a filling and as a topper, w/ garnishes of strawberries.  The bottom had a tan-colored layer, which I assumed would taste like mocha, but I didn't detect any coffee notes.  At first glance, I thought it might have been flourless, but closer inspection revealed a cake-y texture.  This cake was served slightly warm and tasted very good.  DPPM deserved my vote for ""best birthday cake"" by offering both vegan and non-vegan cakes, IMO!BREAD BASKET: White cake, cherry and vanilla filling, and frosting.Liked the flavor combo and the cake's texture, but I was felt like the flavors could've been a little more potent. (Summers Fruit Barn in Phoenix sells breads and pastries from Bread Basket.)I also sampled Sweet Republic's Pumpkin spice ice cream, a seasonal item.  It was fabulous!  I must stop by and taste it again before it leaves the menu!  (Crave Ice Cream and Grateful Spoon Gelato were no-shows.  Boo!)Thank you, DPPM, for the invite!p.s.  Forgive the sorry-looking cupcakes-- they fell as I reached for another slice of cake.  (There were so many others who were reaching for plates from all directions...  What?

I've bought four handbags from here since Christmas 2010- two at retail prices (Bree, a Christmas gift from Mom, and Valencia) for me to keep, and two at sale prices to give out as gifts to my sisters after they saw my Brighton handbags, and I've already taken advantage of the wonderful one-year warranty protection against damages and defects on both Bree and Valencia.  I've also had a pair of sunglasses fixed, since my wearing it as a headband had loosened the hinges and made the ""temple"" pieces expand outward, causing the glasses to slip off my face.  On a tangent, did you know that the scratched lenses of sunglasses you buy here can be replaced for only $5?  (Personally, I think lens replacements should be offered complimentary once a year for the life of the glasses.  Especially since the glasses have to be shipped out to an external location, as do everything else you buy from here that can be serviced, which you then have to wait at least 2 weeks before you get it returned to you, but $5 replacement fee isn't too steep a price to pay... for now.)  I not only value BC for the great customer service and product warranties (free as long as you send in the registration cards at purchase- the friendly BC reps will even fill out the registration cards for you and send them out from the store itself, so you don't have to do it yourself at home, or worse-- forget to fill them out at home, thus losing out on the warranty coverages when the products eventually need cleaning or repair!), but also for the lovely jewelry I've bought here, as well as received as gifts from sister and Mom.  Some of the jewelry have kept well, such as the watches, but I've had bad luck w/ a few of the stainless steel bracelets and necklaces-- some have tarnished and cannot be cleaned w/ baking soda paste and a polish cloth.   Granted, those pieces were from a few years ago, and I have had better luck w/ more recent pieces.Oh!  I must add that I really love the black Fun House large wallet I bought to match an older black and brown handbag (recently cleaned that it looks brand-new!).  The leather used in its construction actually softens w/ age, so it just looks and feels better and better... At first, I didn't like the magnetized flaps, but I actually love how this feature makes the wallet less bulky- no metal clasps or buttons to fumble w/, thus more user-friendly!  I now want to buy more of this style in different colors.  :)Extra!  Extra!If you can wait till February of each year to buy the BC jewelry you lust after, then you will be rewarded with a complimentary set of earrings (no matter what price!) for every set of necklace and bracelet purchased!  The set of earrings don't even have to match the set you buy-- a nice gift to keep for yourself, or to complete a set to give away, as you think about whom you want to buy Valentine gifts for!  ;)p.s.  My older sister is so in love w/ the paprika Bree handbag  I gave her for her birthday!  She held off using it until this fall, and just the other day, she texted another thanks and that she gets complimented on it everyday from coworkers, friends, and strangers!

We only had a couple of hours to look around, since I had school after, but I really did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  Great exhibits- although I wish those that had a larger number of items in the collection would get more space to have a less cluttered showcase.  I need to go back a few more times (or spend two or three long visits) to be able to see everything.  I do not know how large this building is, or even how many rooms/sections it has, but I have a feeling I just saw the tip of the iceberg...  $15 for adult admission seemed a bit steep in the beginning, but after spending only two hours there, I'd say the trip was worth it!  The fact that you get headsets that are synched with switch boxes as you move from one area to another makes the adult admission a great value!  I don't know if the starting ""donation"" fee of $250 for an annual membership is going to win me over though... To you Hard Rock/guitar fans out there, you will want to check out the MiM's lovely collections, and not just the ones on the main level (lovely display by the stairs).  I'm still pretty blown away with the collection of boat lutes of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines on the upper level! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wWhq9cKLCrZHcp-ezp-hPQ?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  (Psst- they're mostly from the Philippines.)

I am pleased to report that while staff members are quick to welcome guests and offer assistance, they know to leave you alone if you ""just want to look.""  The reps I'd met yesterday and on the first visit knew much about their products, and even if they didn't, I had the feeling they'd go to great lengths to find out.  I can't say the same about my second visit, unfortunately, but it was late in the day, fifteen minutes to closing time as a matter of fact, so I didn't mind, since I knew that all of the info I sought was online.  On the other hand, if I wasn't lucky to have internet access and/or reside nearby, I don't know if I'd have cared to return again had I not purchased a Groupon, especially after noting that the rep wasn't inspired enough to look for the info either from printed or online databases, irregardless of the time of day.  I found Ashley to be very helpful during today's visit.I really like that MOST of the products sold here are parabens-free and MOST of the cleansing products are sulfates-free.  I find that I am not able to sample many of the products offered here due to food allergies**, but it's refreshing to find more and more businesses that strive to offer products using natural ingredients- sometimes even organic!  Not only does Lather strive to help people who are looking for natural alternatives in facial, body, hair, and aromatherapy products, but it also gives back to the environment (by packaging their products in containers made from recycled materials, by offering 10% off purchases to customers returning Lather recyclables, and by purchasing carbon off-sets) and to charities by partnering with and contributing to the following three organizations: Carbonfund.org, Cleantheworld.org, and Headaches.org.  To find out more about Lather's mission, history, and the products offered (and their ingredients), check out www.lather.com.  BTW, do you know that Lather only has three locations in the U.S. (CA, GA, and AZ), and that its products can be found in upscale hotels, such as Las Vegas' Borgata and Wynn, and Canyon Ranch?  Granted, I've never been to any of these hotels, but I know of their reputation, so I'm impressed to hear and read that these hotels endorse Lather products.I like the slatted wood soap dish I found here, as it prevents water puddles from forming, thereby extending the life of my exfoliating lavender soap.  If you use delicate glycerine- and olive oil-based soaps, you may find this dish a nice investment, as well.  I hope to update my review in a few months' time (maybe sooner) to write about my experiences with the products I'd bought today, specifically the Vitamin C Peptide Renewal and the Shine Control Face Lotion.**I realized many years ago that those skin rashes and breakouts I'd get from time-to-time were allergic reactions to specific natural ingredients, such as carrot, avocado, corn, rice, and any orange variety, be it orange, bergamot, tangerine, neroli, and so on, to name a few.  (I'm still experimenting with sweet almond oil... I'm thinking it's more of an intolerance, since I am able to tolerate hand and body products, but not facial.  Now that I know which ingredients to avoid, I rarely experience breakouts and rashes.  If only I could stay away from them when I dine out!",7,7,Gu77gOjAIRd0Q3eyKmvRVg,9/13/2013,4,2,36,Shopping

I have posted dozens of photos of my visits to PAM, and I never get to see everything I want to see in one visit!  I like to putter around for hours, looking at objects from different angles, and reading the blurbs of information that go along with them.  I always intend to return every week, so I always plan on going Wednesday nights (when admission is free from 5 pm to 9 pm), but life doesn't comply sometimes, so I decided I'd buy a membership so that I may come and go whenever I please!  If you're a putterer like me, and dislike ruminating among crowds of people, then plan on visiting during the week, especially on Wednesdays, because that is the day when the museum closes late!  Thursday hours allow you only until 5 pm...  I also know that the first weekend of every month is free admission weekend for Bank of America customers (just show your credit/debit card as proof), so unless you plan on taking advantage of that deal, you may want to stay away on those weekends, as I'm sure that draws in larger crowds.  I'm not positive, but I think First Fridays may mean something special for visitors to the museum, as well.  For those who'd like to walk around unencumbered by purses/bags, items of clothing, and other things that you may be carrying with you, because it's just too hot to leave them in the car, you may use the lockers situated to the left of the entrance, free of charge!  You're not supposed to bring outside food or drink, since there's the restaurant/cafe Palette, so you've been warned.  Certain tiers of support allow you a 10% discount at the restaurant and gift shop, as well as access to events tailored to film buffs, social butterflies, and fans of art lectures and talks.If you need a break from studying museum artifacts, you may find your peace either outside, in one of the courtyards, or at one of a few museum overlooks, which are furnished with leather couches and chairs.  Perhaps you'll be lucky enough to find one without people speaking loudly to each other, or on the phone...  Oh, and I just found out a few minutes ago that there's an art library, The Gene and Cathie Lemon Art Research Library, accessible to local residents, too!  It's at the administrative building, the Wolfswinkel Education Center.  I've lived in the valley for 13 years, and I just found out about this.  The books and other info cannot be taken home, but local residents may have access to these and other library resources during public hours, and for those who aren't residents, you may search for titles of interest so that you may know what to borrow at your local libraries, or buy at your bookstore of choice.If the museum, its many courtyards, Palette, the gift shop, and the library aren't enough to whet your appetite for culture, check out the nearby Phoenix Theater!  It's on museum grounds, and I always walk by it on my visits, but I've never had the pleasure to attend a show there (or maybe I have, and I've forgotten because it's been so many years?).  I hope to see at least one show this year, so I'll have to look into their calendar of events soon.I am really looking forward to my next visit!p.s.  Fashionistas!  You may peruse through the museum's online gallery for info on the dresses at phxart.org, under the tabs of Collections, then Fashion, then look for the link to the online gallery, and enjoy!",109,108,xaeKTDO8O4kNDYxupjmBTA,7/1/2016,5,69,33,Shopping

Pepper looking jacket that I tried on...it just didn't work.  For me or anyone.So Scottsdale Quarters also has some upscale stores and Brio restaurant which I have not tried but it has reviewed pretty well.  What they are lacking at this point is a good coffee house where dad's can chill while the kids are at H & M.I like the upward rather than outward design of much of the shopping center.  It would be nice if they add apartments or condos rather than office space above,  Or at least a mix.  That would certainly lend itself toward an urbanism that the Valley is missing.",11,8,_WZTx76796uoIWeH61H_Ww,12/28/2009,3,11,10,Shopping

Turns out my wool topcoat doesn't really cut it in these frigid temperatures and, with the almanac calling for one of the coldest Winters on record, it was about time I invest in an amazingly stylish, comfortable, and WARM winter jacket.  Since I exhausted nearly every option in Chicago I thought I would give my search a whirl at home.  A quick Yelp search led me to Appalachian Outfitters......which I have passed by hundreds of times.  I went to high school down the road and my former-athlete self used to frequent Virginia Kendall on a regular basis.  Who knew this place was such a treasure?I was impressed with how busy the place was on a Saturday but given that it was sandwiched between Black Friday and Cyber Monday it seemed there were many looking to score some great deals.  I found my way over to the Men's section (which loops around the left side of the building from the entrance) to see what I could find.  There are your more well-known names: North Face, Patagonia, Mountain Hardwear, etc. along with several lesser-known (read: smaller operations and foreign) brands.  I wanted something to mix up my excessive amount of North Face and Mountain Hardwear jackets in my closet and was excited to see that they carry the Jack Wolfskin line.  When I was in Germany a couple years ago I noticed EVERYONE was wearing this brand and, although I am not fashion forward, I thought it strange I had never heard of it.  I really liked the style but had not seen it anywhere else until I stopped in this store.  Since most of the jackets are locked with cables I had to wait a few minutes before an associate came by to try it on.  Soon Andrea, one of the associates, stopped by and we spent a bit of time talking about the brand, other stock they carry, the weather, and a bunch of other things.  Admittedly I tend to avoid store associates like the plague but this was a time that I really needed some help, and Andrea was there to help out.  Even the SO ended up walking out with an impulse buy.  If only she were to have gotten a commission on the sales!  This store has a wide selection of items for all your outdoorsy activities.  Even before the Black Friday discount I thought the prices were completely fair and was happy that they have a rewards program (which calculated to approximately 2%) for repeat shoppers.  The added bonus was that I was able to support a local business.  Win-win for all!Though distance will prevent me from making this a more regular go-to for my outdoors needs I will definitely be recommending it to friends and family in the area.

THIS is art I can get down with. On a brief visit to Pittsburgh, this was one of top items on our very limited 'To-Do' list. We opted to skip the Warhol Museum and 'go to the Mattresses' because it seemed a bit more dynamic and also, I'll be honest, cheaper. Now, I'm not an art fanatic by any means. I look at it, I see things, I don't feel any emotional attachment, nothing's stirred, nothing moves me. I'm just dead inside. It's just a thing I'm looking at, that means zilch to me, though I'd be more than happy to assign anything 'art' a number from 1-10 to accurately show how boring or not boring I find it. Ignorant? Yes. Most definitely. But it's honest and I'd like to think there's a bit of honor in coming clean over bullshitting through some phony explanation of why something I really don't care for is or isn't poignant, and with that being said I liked the Mattress Factory because it didn't feel like a stuffy art museum. It was fun, you could move about almost freely, no guards, just guides and at points you're even encouraged to explore and touch. What I liked about the Mattress factory was that it had a sense of humor. It wasn't all serious all the time as we quickly discovered upon entering the 'Breast in the Press' installation, consisting of a dark room with an absolutely enormous statue of a topless woman with comically huge breasts and a music video being projected in onto each boob to the tune of 'My Humps' by the Black-Eyed Peas, but with the words changed and the large-breasted creator of the work singing topless while smashing her inked up breasts against sheets of paper at a desk, as if she was writing the news with her fun bags. This was an exhibit we saw back in November/December, and still, if I hear any clip of 'My Humps', I can't help but think of the Mattress Factory titty song. Another exhibit we walked into and 'accidentally' crushed part of. I use mini-quotes for the word 'accidentally' because at first I really did step on one of the ping pong balls littering the rectangular room on accident, but then when it popped and no one from the museum came out to yell at me I took it as free reign to do it again... and again, and again, and again and then eventually I just started picking them up started throwing them at my friends- triple words score if you hit in the testiculars! Anyway, I don't know what the artist wanted me to get from the exhibit, but I just assumed it was a test in seeing how long it took a regular museum-goer to turn delinquent and start wrecking sh*t. The exhibits using light were really cool. All optical illusion-y and the one pitch black room where you're only supposed to go two-at-a-time was great for scaring friends. We had a truce to not creep up or bad touch anyone in the exhibit, but of course we all failed to withhold our end of the treaty and it went from a silent 2-person exhibit to a screeching, poking, fondling, scary exhibit. Again, I don't know what I was supposed to take away from it, but somehow we all ended up interpreting it as the another 'break the rules' room. The doll room was creepy, but cool. As a hoarder, I appreciated being able to show my friends one place that might be scarier than mess-menagerie at my own place. Now maybe I'll invite them over. The room with the water was fun to jump from stone to stone and throw rocks and the sound thing hanging from the ceiling was neat if you were lucky enough to be by while someone walked over it from the floor above, but they should really make the 'Do not touch' sign bigger if they really don't want you to touch it, because I did not see that sh*t till my hands already gave it a good touch.The mirror room was the best part next to boobs. It's kind of silly, but it felt more interactive because you have to either take your shoes off or put mesh booties on to enter. It basically a bunch of colors and dots and mirrors and a few mannequins, but you can see yourself from all angles and somehow it was more fun than a standard dressing room, though it was basically the same, but with more decoration. Our group probably would've stayed here all day if there wasn't another group waiting to go in. There's more to the museum than just the one building, if you leave there's an outdoor area that was awesome because I saw a lizard go down the well thing and then I tried to catch it but I almost fell in the mud and my friends were ready to move on and climb other stuff, then if you go down the back alley/parking lot, around the corner and down up the road, you just flash your badge/ticket stub and you can see their other exhibit made up of odd housing installations. It wasn't reveting, but I liked the little hidden words and phrases found throughout the house. It felt like getting the fortune slip out of a fortune cookie, but without having to eat it.

No hybrid here, the hair's just gone.Me: I see.  **These are actual conversations from my tour of Trundle last Saturday, and one of the best tourist destinations I've ever had the good fortune to see**First off, I can't believe I get to be the first to review the infamous Trundle Manor. What.An.Honor. But I do have one question: How the hell has Trundle flown under the Yelp radar for so damn long? Step up your game, Pittsburgh! Don't let these gems pass you by. All my life I've been told that I'm strange, and in that life I've been to a lot of strange places, but this one is up there--even for me. Defo top 5, maybe even top 2 and absolutely a place a you should put on your bucket list, no matter who you are. Sure, dead sh*t in jars, hobo treasures and the singing steam-punk stomach tumor of a beloved belly dancer might not sound like everyone's idea of a good time, but try to keep an open mind and know that one trip to Trundle Manor will not only act as the centerpiece of your Pittsburgh memories, but as a major talking piece for the rest of your life. Promise. The only issue will be trying to find any place that can live up to the wonderment and awe of Pittsburgh's TM. The Curators of Trundle Manor's curiosities are the aforementioned Mr Arm and his lovely lady-friend/fiancee, Velda Von Minx. There's also a live cat amongst all the collected, stuffed and jarred felines named Little Devil who's just the biggest sweetheart. Their story is pretty cute and while I don't want to ruin it for you, it involves two taxidermied married squirrels that are on display in the den. Touring the manor is by appointment only, but there are times of the year where they don't do tours at all because the demand is just too high, namely in October when Halloween requests run rampant. If you're lucky enough to get an appointment to tour the manor, you should note that there is no official cost, though donations are accepted (and encouraged... by me). Keep Trundle truckin'! They'll accept cash in the donation box in the foyer or donation of dead animals, medical devices, cleavers, alcohol (no beer) or anything creepy, just don't be cheap--There's lots of eyes watching you at the manor. Among the many oddities already mentioned, you can also spy a number of the items below and then some. - Papa, Momma and Baby Bear + GoldiFox- An old-timey medical syringe that's large enough to act as a cattle prod- A cat on a hat- Legos- Colon photos- 100+ year old stuffed fox- Old electro-shock machine- Jar of human teeth- Jar of human skin flakes- Jar of human finger and toe nails- Tentacles- A family of amphibians- A happy turtle/chick hybrid family of five- Steampunk bears- Bindle stick bundles- A gerbil named 'poop'- Ray guns- Gimp-type masks- Original Addams family goodies- Carnival treasures- Classically un-classic built-up cars, fit for the zombie apocalypse- I got lucky and found a rogue bird foot on the floor during my tour, so keep your eyes peeled for hidden treats- And soooo much more...When you go (and you NEED to go) be sure to take pics, bring a decent donation and do ask as many questions as can. Half the fun is getting to hear the story behind each of the items from Velda and Mr Arm. If curious, peculiar, macabre are your thing, or even if you were ever a fan of the hit Nickelodeon show Cat-Dog, this is THE place to hit up if you're interesting in seeing a collection of quirk that you won't see anywhere else in the entire world.",29,28,XzG9VrMZqppKPevASqooLg,12/5/2012,5,27,34,Shopping

In fact, I f*cking hate it. But when I hear there's a market that has hand-made this & that and beer aaand outdoor grilling... well, now you've piqued my interest. Right off the bat I liked this event because I got a free full-size Fuze beverage thing before I even walked in the door. I'd never tried Fuze before and I'm also very poor so the idea of being able to get something tasty for $0 was, as you can imagine, a pretty big draw for a hoodrat like me. moving on...On a late Saturday afternoon the market was reasonably packed, but not as bad as some the hand-made markets with beer that I've attended back home. I like that the vendors were set up a bit segregated so anything with or for kids was kind of off to the side since kids are infamous for gumming up the works at crowded fests. The separation helped me avoid any situations where I might have to explain myself after ""accidentally"" kicking some child who's not yet mentally capable of recognizing the unspoken but agreed upon social flow of the marketplace, and over all kept the babies and their P's out of my impatient hair though there was at least one mother(f*cker) who thought the busy and crowded market was the perfect place to teach her 10-month old how to walk, and for that I mentally sentenced her to death by antique steam-punk firing squad... which conveniently there was a booth for. There were a few really neat vendors but because it seemed like most or all were to limited to their area of one standard-size folding table and the space behind it. I don't think shops were able to display too many items and I'm going to assuming that because of the table-size limitation. Vendors had to pick and choose a limited variety of stock to bring/display and that caused a lot of the vendors inventory to look really mis-matched and random. As an example, it seemed pretty par for the course to see one single vendor selling art prints of movie stills, knit owl barrettes and steam-punk business card holders, and while I'm sure there's a market for all of those things, there was a disconnection in the goods that translated to making the table look less desirable.On the other hand, because vendors had just a single table space and not an area where they could create a store cubby type nook with multiple tables and curtains, there was no getting grid-locked into a booth and not being able to get in or out or even see the goods. You were able to walk straight through the three main aisles and pretty clearly see what kind of stuff each vendor offered without having to squish in and fight for a spot to view the table, which was really nice and saved a lot of time, though it did mean that each shopper spent less time looking at a vendor's goods than the cubby/nook mock storefront way where you sort of get sucked in and trapped in into looking more and buying more. My favorite booths were the craft beer candles that smelled fantastic and were in old glass beer bottle that had been sawed in half and smoothed over as well as the super crowded jewelry vendor in the very back. I ended up getting (or being gifted by a very special someone) this bullet necklace I'd been eyeing. This market was great because while the shopping was all indoor, there was a beer tent outside, a hula hoop station (also a vendor) and multiple local Restaurant had brought their goods and set up shop to grill on the plaza outside the market. And while everything smelled like delicious, smoky heaven, the lines were wrapping around the nearby businesses so we opted to wait it out and grab food elsewhere. I would definitely recommend I made it market to anyone with an urge to shop local and an hour or so to kill. It's not a destination or all day type thing, but it's a great mix of quality craft and the community, as well as being far from any super boring Holly Hobby church craft fair type thing. Check it out when it's in town. It's totally free to attend and fun way to spend an afternoon with friends, fam, kids or just yourself.",15,10,HUTz4sgTtOT-doB1VL7VRQ,12/7/2012,4,11,32,Shopping

I give it three stars for a serious ""hit-or-miss"", and one extra star for plenty of parking and just because I love flea markets and outdoor markets. There's also two produce sellers inside who have great prices for avocados. I love me some avocado, especially at 85 cents a pop! I've picked up a week's worth of veggies for under $10.The parking can be a pain unless you navigate the outskirts of the lot. There is really nothing more annoying than gridlock due to 2 or 3 people who can't figure out what the f* they're doing. I realize we're in the ""laid back South"", but some of us don't want to spend our lives idling our cars and holding our breath until we get to move a few inches forward only to stop again. I've found decent stuff about 50% of the time I come here. It's a good place to find quirky gifts (Beatrix Potter dishware for that random Peter Rabbit fan.. did I just date myself?), or if you need some bakeware. Seriously I found a 9x12 Pyrex for $6. That'd be, what, $20+ at Target? It's not a screaming deal, but you'd have better luck here than at a thrift shop.. and it smells a lot nicer. About 65% of the booths are nonsense: old Avon products and cheap shoes or junk food. Gross. At least 20% of the booths are cell phone cases and accessories. The cases seem pretty cheap and not in the good way, but the cords are legit. Most of them will carry the original manufacturer charging cables for pretty cheap. I've seen some seriously nice stuff here, like a stone chess set that was just gorgeous. The guy said it was $40, which of course in flea market world really means somewhere between $33-38, or something (I'm not very good at the haggling). I've seen beautiful African carvings, seasonal items (Christmas dishtowels for $2, anyone?), even some pretty decent bookshelves. I would recommend several things:- Right around 9:45-10am seems to be the magic time during the colder months. I think it was more 9:15am during the summer. - Skirt the parking lot or pull up right to the building-doorways. It's like people are afraid to go all the way in (just the tip?!?), so I've always found spots here.- Bring cash to make your life easier, but do the small bills. It helps if you're haggling not to whip out the $20 bill. At least it helps me feel like less of a d*ck.- Get some tamales at Rico's Tamales. It's in the 2nd building in towards the center where the restrooms are. Trust me on this. They're $2 each and they are easily some of the most delicious tamales I've had outside of Mexico and Southwestern America. It's out of a truck and there's a fancy hand printed and lopsided sign.

That being said, I was in need of a suit and looked up Bruce Julian via yelp and saw that the store had great reviews - wanted to give it a shot, and I was not disappointed one bit.I walked in after work around 5 pm and was immediately greeted by Diana, super -personable and ready to help me and my ""suiting up"" needs.  Just by eyeing me in the few seconds of talking, we set out to find my size since I did not recall my jacket size.  She was pretty spot on too with the first jacket I tried on... it fit like a glove.  Nothing like a nice fitting jacket.  As we were trying jackets on, Diana got a feel for what color, what occasion I needed the suit for, and just was fun to talk to her about how a suit should fit and all the options.  SO MANY OPTIONS.  She basically was grabbing suits off the rack left and right and we settled on two that I ""felt good in"" - then she took me to the back to meet Cheryl to make sure the ""fit"" was correct.  It was great having so much expertise under one roof.  If the suit didn't fit just right, Cheryl could work her magic and do some nipping and tucking to get me looking 007 caliber.Diana actually offered me a bloodymary.... which was super tempting especially after a long work-day.  There is a small bar in the store!!! It was nice to find out that Bruce sells his own Bloody Mix - and he was actually in Charleston with his wife at a convention for it.  Hopefully I get to meet him since his store is overflowing with his personality.  It is not everyday you walk into a suit store and see star wars action figures displayed by the mannequins.

I hope the show does well since you can't really get much more personal than a nude ;)The bartender had selected music from The Brian Jonestown Massacre... so it made for some really nice atmosphere to check out the art and to enjoy a few brews.

I always forget how many options you have when quilting so it can be a bit overwhelming, but I explained my original plan and vision and she helped me make some decisions.  I had arrived a little early for our meeting, so I got to look around the shop... you can buy fabric, accessories, books, measuring implements, and also take classes here.  Everyone was super friendly and I even got to watch this gentlemen use the quilting machine (its super big) and it's the finishing swirls and patterns you see on the finished product.

They even have an outdoor patio.Not only that, this store is huge. Wide aisles, fresh meat that I haven't seen at my former usual store (East Blvd) like ground elk and bison and also a great selection of organic produce items at cheaper prices than Whole Foods. Another great thing is the daily meal bar. One day it's a mongolian noodle meal, or a lobster meal or a prime rib meal or an omelette station.The staff has been wonderful and very helpful. Parking is a breeze - at least for now when none of the other businesses are open. And it's convenient. I love this store and it has now become my regular Teeter. Sorry East Blvd store.",4,2,Qw8_pltJeFdePRErJEawTw,7/19/2017,5,2,24,Shopping

I was hoping Publix was like Harris Teeter and had a salad bar.  Nope, they do not, or at least it was not where I would expect it.  What they do have is a deli that creates custom sandwiches which are extremely popular as the line was 25 deep and they were lined up through the deli area so if you wanted to see if they had premade sandwiches you had to fight through all the people.  Finally found SMALL pre-made sandwiches and side salads.But it was so crowded that I could not see if they had any condiments for my sandwich.  At this point I was thoroughly annoyed and just wanted to get out of there.  But NOoooooo. Couldn't get out that easy. Then I get stuck behind people who want to walk 3 wide and hog and entire aisle and walk as slow as possible.Honestly the Bi-lo that was here before was more organized for the deli area.  Their sandwich and hot food bar was right in front which made more sense.What saved this from being a 2-star review is the customer service up front. Somebody was waiting for me and took me right away. Yay and she and the bagger were very friendly and helpful.  Thanks for the Publix reusable bag too. I only had 2 items though so it seemed like a waste.So far Publix, I am not a fan but I only came here for a QUICK in and out for lunch.

The store is laid out well. TV's in the front, food items on both sides and in the back, non-food items in the middle and in the front.

I'm not that old. In demographer terms I'm a millennial. But I did start going to school before cell phones could fit in a pocket, much less a bag. Naturally, the internet wasn't a thing and I typed my earliest reports on an electric typewriter. Our first computer had a tube screen and a dot matrix printer that used accordioned paper with perforated edges you could tear off. When I did reports, I went to the library to find books for research. In high school, as the internet became a thing my teachers clutched with false-hopes to their demands that we cite actual books. By the time I made it to college, internet catalogs like JSTOR, where you can find most scholarly articles at your fingertips in the comfort of your own dorm room or home, were the in-thing.I came to Charlotte for college and used the UNCC library extensively when I couldn't find a good source on JSTOR. That's a wonderful library. Because of it, I never had the need to sign up for the Mecklenburg County library system. After graduating, my need for a library was gone. I joined the working world and never looked back. Seven years later my interest in reading rekindled and I started having the insatiable desire to stick my nose in a book. In walks the CMECK Library.Now that I've finished my personal life story, I'll tell you about this library. It's the location of choice where I signed up to start my new membership. Located right off the ""Booty Loop"", a popular cyclist riding spot, I pass it frequently. It's a super convenient location in a relatively walkable or bikeable area. Outside there's a cute garden greeting you as you walk in the door. Inside the door there's a rack of magazines and newspapers like Endurance and Creative Loafing. On the counter you can find a regularly updated list of the top NY times best sellers. Across from the desk you can find many of these best sellers and other popular books on two small shelves alongside the most recent DVD releases.For the newer DVDs there is a very small rental fee of $2 that covers a few days. Still better than RedBox if you ask me. Older DVDs come free of charge and we've been using this to rewatch Star Wars. There are computers available, some desks to work at and comfy chairs to sit in and read. Space is quite limited as this is a very small branch library. The selection is also limited but there are still a lot of books coming from a guy who hasn't been in a library in years. The Nonfiction is organized by subject (using call numbers) which is a bit confusing to a newcomer like me. The Fiction is organized by author last name. There is a young adult section and on the far back side of the library a children's section with ample toys. There are even doors here - lots of good thinkin' went into the design to keep as much noise as possible out of the main area.I use the library's online holds and lists system to keep track of and rate what I've read. It's worlds above what amazon offers for the same. (They tend to favor trying to get you to buy stuff.) The manager of this branch helped me find my way and understand the call number system. She was incredibly considerate, being that I knew jack-diddly! She was actually happy to guide me through, saying she doesn't get to do that often. There are also plenty of opportunities to volunteer. Though small, this library feels very cozy and like a hidden gem. Every time I come buy I feel like I'm in a sanctuary of fantasy that can pull me out of the stress of the real world. Yeah I'll say it, it's like getting lost in a book.

Trips for Kids itself is a not-for-profit organization with ""chapters"" around the country dedicated strictly to community outreach teaching kids to ride and getting them interested in bikes while at the same time leading ""Earn-A-Bike"" programs through which they encourage good behavior and grades in school by rewarding students with bikes. And honestly speaking I have no direct personal experience with the Trips for Kids - I ain't got no kids myself and they tend to be annoying little buggers.The ReCyclery on the other hand is the not-for-profit business through which Trips for Kids is supported. Here they repair and refurbish old donated bicycles and resell them or provide them to the Trips for Kids programs. Any ""profit"" is used to pay the few employees, pay for operating costs and put back into the programs. Volunteering is open to pretty much anyone, but you are required to take their introductory class. Volunteers get to use their time as credit to purchase anything from the shop.On the topic of the shop, they've got an excellent friendly crowd of what I like to call ""bicycle engineers"". Most of the team can tell you anything that's wrong with your bike and get it fixed or replaced in a jiffy. Granted they all spend most of their time here working on bikes non-stop. You can buy any kind of bike here or just buy the parts if you prefer to do the work yourself. You have the opportunity to have your bike repaired with reused/recycled parts or new ones. And you can be certain that the work is done well. Most adult bikes here seem to average in the mid-$200s. Which frankly is awesome for what you get. A fully overhauled bike with new tubes, tires, chain, break and shifter cables, etc. re-greased and fine-tuned oftentimes even better than new. And you will often see relatively nice frames from good brands too (Trek, Surly, Raleigh, etc.).I've heard some staff here can be fairly ""unhelpful"" but you will have to bear in mind that half of the folks working here most days are volunteers and don't have the permissions to run payments. A lot of them are also more interested in coming in and working on bikes it seems. My advice: when you come in just don't be afraid to speak up and announce yourself and say what you're looking for. There can often be a sense of disarray in here with people all off in their own little worlds at the bike stands.",3,1,zTDUHGv-GKTqDsQ9MI-2OA,3/8/2017,5,2,47,Shopping

I've avoided the place for a while now simply because of the outrageous prices. Yes, let's fess up, the prices are outrageous. I've been told more than once by a friend of mine that they don't want to pay $70 for a pair of yoga shorts that are just gonna get dirty and sweaty. That said, here's my review.I started off slow with Lulu Lemon. First off, I had just heard they set up shop in Birkdale so I had to stop in just because. Also, I'm a regular runner these days so I thought why not check out some more fashionable workout wear? I went in, looked around and was pretty well impressed with the style and options. If you're the kinda guy or girl that likes to spend most of your day in comfy athletic gear, this is a place you'd probably want to frequent. However, as I said, I started off slow. I was impressed with their ""silver"" line. They weave silver thread through all manner of clothing to help cut down on microbes and their respective odors. I bought a pair of socks ($18) with this technology. They are excellent for running. Keep your feet cool, dry and comfy. I now have 3 pair. Yes, I agree the price is high but I also feel it's worth it.I decided to graduate to a nice pair of shorts next. I was pretty impressed with the Surge shorts and the Pacebreaker shorts. I settled on the Pacebreaker H2O because it was pitched as an ""everything"" short. Studio (yoga), gym and beach ready. I liked the concept and I think they would make great swimming trunks, but they ended up being horrible for running and for yoga. Of all things, yoga. That's right, even with the neat little Lulu Lemon logo on them, they did not excel at doing what the brand is known best for. They bound up in the legs making it difficult to really get that true stretch. So, I got in contact with their customer service folks and shared my thoughts. They were stellar, to say the least. Despite me having trial tested them, they took the shorts back and I switched to the Surge shorts which are shorter and not at all binding. I suspect they will be perfect for running and yoga and could even be used at the beach in times of need.The point in me writing this long winded review is that while I'm not a huge fan of the prices at Lulu Lemon, I am happy to find that the quality and the service are a reflection of that pricing. I would tell anyone, even the hesitant folks, to give it a try. You may be as impressed as I was.",4,1,b-qb3-7zzGJkLQ44PskFzg,7/4/2015,4,1,40,Shopping

Seems like every time I go in the store, this one in particular, they are in a perpetual state of entropic disorganization. You can never really find the alternative sizes for a shirt you like because they're all in mixed piles on tabletops. It's also as if they are constantly remodeling. In particular you can always be sure to find that the men's section has shrunk a little more each time you visit. I have never once come in here to find it perfectly organized.That said, I can still award Old Navy 3 stars. While the clothes aren't top quality, they still manage to have a decent variety of menswear squeezed into what little bit of area remains. Lately I noticed they've got a lot of shirts that emphasize ""going outside"" and nature and such. It seems to be the trend these days, at least for me. Though that won't change my dislike for ""shirts with words on them"". And if you're in that boat with me, you will be delighted to find that ON has a great selection of both patterned and plain shirts to be had. This includes my personal favorite: heather. You know that sort of washed out/textured look that is added to make a single color shirt look more complex. I love that design and Old Navy has it on lock. Another personal favorite of mine here is the selection of work-out-wear for men. Lots of color, lots of visibility and reflectivity and actually a dash of style that is on the level of H&M for men's work out gear.Be aware that their clothes all seem to run large and short and they absolutely do shrink in the dryer.

On the price side, I guess they're reasonable. Considering I have no prior experience buying riding gear I can't say for sure. But helmets run the gambit from under $100 (Skorpion, etc.) up to several several hundred dollars (Arai, Shoei, etc.). Jackets too, depending on brand and features. I got mine for around $150 but they go down to low $100s and up to several hundred. There are more gloves than you can wrap your brain around, much less your fingers! $30~$80 roughly.Lots of motorcycles also for sale here. US and Japanese bikes alike.

No longer can the recession be blamed for lack of business because if I go to Carolina Place, South park, or Concord Mills, I can't find a parking spot on the weekend.

The food court is typical as is the mandatory Starbucks.  I do like that the main restrooms near the food court have waterless urinals - those things are awesome.There also some decent Restaurant like Bravo's but I generally don't go to a mall to go to restaurant.  The anchor stores are oddly placed - like Dillard's at the far end of the mall.  Most Dillard's are slow, so they don't need anything to hinder their business (hint - if you can't find a place to park at a mall and it has a Dillard's, there will usually be places to park).

Thus it was, on a trip to Madison, that I cleverly took my jewelin' pal into Tropic Jewel for a quick supply run, while secretly planning to turn her into my own personal one-woman sweatshop.First I must tell you that Tropic Jewel is flippin' hot in summertime.  It's on the second story of this weird strip mall, so you not only have to haul yourself up a flight of stairs, but once you get up there, there's no A/C waiting for you.  Pause and catch your breath before heading in, because it gets stuffy in there when it's crowded.If you have any interest in jewelry-making at all, though, is this ever the place for you.  Shelves and shelves of bead trays, sorted by color, contain every kind of bead you could imagine and then some.  One whole table is devoted to pearls, natural and dyed.  In addition to smaller beads, they have large semi-precious stone pendants and even some metal pendants.  There's also a good selection of findings, tools, and kits.  I especially liked the beginners' kits, which had everything you needed to make, say, a pair of chandelier earrings or a bracelet.  Lots of times those beginners' kits are pretty lame, but these projects were actually cool things that you'd want to wear - or give as gifts.We picked out some nice coin pearls, glass beads, and other beads for me, and with my friend's help, I ended up getting three pairs of earrings for less than what one pair would have cost in a department store.  But even if you're not a jewelry expert, the staff is helpful and will answer your questions, and I believe they even hold classes there to teach beginners how to use their new purchases.If you can take the heat (it's not called Tropic Jewel for nothing), this is a nice place to browse, plan projects, or pick up a piece of finished jewelry for yourself or someone else.  It was almost enough to make me want to take up beading myself - like I need another time-sucking hobby in my life.",4,2,Urz44DVjS6-1fSyPlClQOw,7/22/2006,4,5,24,Shopping

Don't go to the Strip, with its skeevy souvenir stores and pricey casino malls.  Instead, head over to the Las Vegas Outlet Mall, where you can actually get something for your money besides the thrill of plunking it into a one-armed bandit.This outlet mall is huge, and it just goes on and on...and on.  And on.  It's so big that there are two food courts, and one of them is located next to a carousel.  Yes, there is a somewhat random feel to the layout and selection of stores, but it's such a diverse mix that there will be something for everyone in your group to browse through - though you might have some trouble meeting up again later.Some of my favorite stores include the Fossil outlet, which has tables of $20 and $30 watches (but make sure they check the battery before you leave); Charlotte Russe, which has a fun mix of funky and bohemian women's clothes, and a giant clearance rack in the back (I got a super-cute skirt there for $8 that I wear all the time); Vans, which has styles you won't see in regular stores and a big sale section; and Levi's, where you can get irregulars for half the price of normal Levi's.Other notable stores include Liz Claiborne, Jones New York, Nike, Reebok, and Tommy Hilfiger.  Shoe lovers will find Adidas, Bass, Skechers, and Naturalizers, among others.  There are home furnishings stores (Mikasa, Black & Decker), leather stores (Wilson, and, soon, Coach), and gourmet foods (Harry & David, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory).  As with any ""outlet"" mall, there are some stores that seem suspiciously non-outlet, and some weird stores that are just oddball (like the rocks 'n' geodes shop).  Plan to spend at least an afternoon here, particularly if you're hiding out from the intense Vegas heat.

But no!  There is art to be found in the City of Sin... you just have to know where to look.

Some of the paintings he has are things you'd never expect to see outside a museum.  The Wynn Collection came to the Nevada Museum of Art (in Reno) last year, so I saw it then, and was impressed.  When the Wynn casino opened, the collection initially had its own gallery, nestled off the main floor near the shops, which Nevada residents could get into for $3, making it one of the few genuine bargains in Vegas.But since money is, after all, the prime consideration, the gallery was closed earlier this year due to poor ticket sales, and the space will be converted into retail space for more of the couture brands that already grace the Wynn's shopping mall.  Fortunately, the art itself didn't go away, and the pieces have been redistributed around the casino, with the showpiece - Picasso's ""Le Reve"" - displayed in the main lobby.I haven't seen the collection since it was taken out of the gallery, but it's an impressive selection of pieces by Warhol, Singer, van Gogh, Manet, Gaugin, and Jan Brueghel the Younger, among others.

Marti was extremely accommodating and I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the pricing for our group was reasonable compared to some of the other cooking schools that I was looking into.  There was a great selection of menus to choose from as well.  I went with the ""Easy Entertaining"" option, which included recipes for the following items:* Baked Brie with Shallots & Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce* Smoked Salmon Cakes with Lemon Dill Aioli* Grilled chicken Satay with Ginger Mustard Sauce* Bloody Mary Shrimp* Pork Pot Stickers with Garlic Soy* Pepper-Crusted Steak with Horseradish cream* Mini Caramel Pecan Pies with Bourbon whipped CreamWhen the group arrived, there were aprons for all, and Marti introduced herself and Chef Linda prior to us beginning.  Our group was ready to get our hands dirty right away, but we did have to be patient as Chef Linda walked us through each recipe... From there, we buddied up (except for Emi H who bravely took on the Chicken Satay on her own) and were on our own with the large kitchen and ingredients.  Tiffany and I did the Brie which was by far the easiest, but we had fun with it and it turned out incredibly (if I can say so myself)!All in all, this was a fabulous evening, and great for team building too... but if you do book Sweet Basil, a couple of things to keep in mind that may be helpful:*While SB does provide iced tea and water, they allow BYOB, so if your group is anything like mine, I do recommend taking advantage and bringing some wine!*You'll likely begin your class promptly at 6:30, but won't be digging into the food for quite some time, so you may want to grab a bite prior to arriving or ask about purchasing some snacks to nosh on while you eat.In addition to the above, note that SB is also a fabulous store for all kinds of cookware, kitchen accessories, and more...

Do not order the Seafood Pistou.  Larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, I ordered it anyways.  It was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  The seafood didn't taste so fresh and I think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  However, Kristin C. chose right - she had the Ahi Tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to Kristin, it was fantastic!  Note to self:  order Ahi if I ever return!  Oh, and I tasted the Asian Pear Salad too - it was tasty.  So, the 2.5 star rating is an average...

But now that I'm a ""grown-up"" I can honestly say that I can cook! It took major life changes and the possibility of starvation to do it, but through cookbooks and the internet, I can boldly say that I am able to cook anything as long as I've got a recipe! So when we went to the Sweet Basil cooking school for a work outing I was excited to put my cooking skills to the test.We started off with Linda our instructor giving us an overview of what we were cooking and she had us volunteer to break off into pairs. She asked for one person to go solo and I raised my hand. Our menu for the evening was ""Easy Entertaining"" and were a mix of sweet and savory dishes. I had the task of making grilled chicken satay skewers. It took about 90 minutes for everyone to finish cooking and we ate the dishes as they were completed. Each recipe was easy to prepare and there were a handful I'd choose to make at home for parties. My skewers needed to be grilled and that's a skill I've never honed so it was nice to do something new! Our instructor Linda was very nice and she reminded me of the days when I used to cook with my grandmother. She was very encouraging and made me feel really great about my dish! I think in my next life I will go to culinary school and become a chef! Not so I can open a restaurant per se, but simply because I enjoy creating dishes and making folks happy through food!Great team building exercise and a nice change from the regular sit down dinners. It's BYOB but I'd warn that you should probably eat something before hand because it'll be awhile before you get to eat your dinner!

This approach was perfect as the Boo is your quintessential procrastinator.  xe2x80x8dAnyway, two days later we went back. Received the same warm welcome.

Parking is in the back- be careful parking anywhere else, as your car might get towed.  There are misters for those who like eating outside.  Since I've only been here once, and I had to eat at the bar area for happy hour, I don't know what the noise level is indoors, but it certainly seems nice in there, if not a bit cramped.  A big minus for me is that smoking is allowed outside, so I'm hoping to secure a table indoors on my next visit.Ordered the only cocktail on the menu that uses ginger liqueur (sorry, but I forgot the name), and really liked it!  It tasted light and refreshing, but packed quite a punch, so be careful-- it went down very smoothly and very fast!  Happy hour knocked off only $1, down to $9, so I suppose it's good that the bartender had a heavy hand.  ;)  As for my entree, I had the Roasted poblano, artichoke, and spinach dip, which came w/ both crostini and water crackers.  Skip the water crackers (they felt stale when I bit into them, and they're very bland) and stick w/ the crispy, nicely-toasted, and olive oil-drizzled crostini.  I did, and I ate the entire thing!  (Well, minus the water crackers.)  The base was very creamy, yet also chunky (I love foods that layer on many textures!), and I really appreciated the heat that the roasted poblanos brought to this dish.  From the moment I took that first bite, I thought that  this dish was different from any other spinach and artichoke dips I've ever tried.  Try it if you're into s/a dips, and let me know what you think of this one!The rest of the menu sounds great, but can get very pricey (salads and soups, $6-10; starters, $10-19; and entrees, $20-32).

Finally had the chance to check this once-a-month feature SL holds every first Wednesday (where an established customer takes along someone who's never been to take advantage of the BOGO offering (buy one, get one).  I was told that this feature applies only towards spa services, but that I'd be able to take Mom in so that we'd both be able to get a shampoo/cut and color.Now, first I have to say that my first coloring (Feb.) didn't last very long- I noticed fading within the first two weeks!  I thought perhaps using another color-enhancing shampoo/conditioner set after one week of religious use of Aveda products may have been the culprit (perhaps chemicals in the second set caused color to fade), but after discussing it with Rachael, I decided I'd use more expensive color-safe products, shampoo less (I normally wash my hair twice a day on the days I work, and at least once-a-day on my days off), AND rinse with cold water after every shower to ensure that the hair cuticles properly close, but no... Mom and I BOTH noticed significant color fading WITHIN the FIRST week of the treatment.Other disappointments include Mom's complaint of uneven shearing of her hair; my slight disappointment in the way my hair ""moves"" with the new haircut; the very small pool area out back, and the lack of privacy we encountered compared to the other spas we've experienced while accessing the pool, sauna, and steam rooms, to name a few.  To add insult to injury, the receptionist decided to skip me and take care of the group of older women behind me when it came time to pay.  After a few minutes, when she was ready to direct her attention to me, the receptionist first tried to charge double for the services- basically negating the BOGO offer, but I reminded her that we were there for ""Live at Lamar,"" so she then tried to do a ""buy one, get 50% off the second"" deal, to which I again balked at.  I also added a couple of hair products to my bill, and after I had given her enough spafinder gift certificates to cover the salon services, the products, and Rachael's tip (20% of what TWO sets of cut and color would regularly cost), she tried to tell me that I still had a balance that needed to go on a credit card, citing that the tip could not be paid with the certificates!?!?  I asked how she arrived at this conclusion after I ran down the bill and the certificate amounts I'd given her, writing everything on paper.  She apologized and said she had not realized I'd already included Rachael's tip (!?!?).  Whatever great experiences I could've relayed to friends, relatives, coworkers, and clients about SL's ""Live at Lamar"" flew out the window within those closing minutes.  And then, not even a week later, Mom and I noticed the significant color loss...I'd hate to have to find another spa and hair stylist/colorist, since Rachael seems to be a genuinely friendly and sincere person, but if I can't come away feeling blissful and know I got great color/value for the money, how can I recommend this spa to others?  How can I go back and pay for haircolor that doesn't even last a week?  Mom still complains every now and then (and it's only been 19 days, for goodness' sake!), and our only consolation is that I can't take her back for another ""Live at Lamar"" experience since it's a feature only good for those clients' friends who've never been.  Hmm... kind of ironic, when you think about it...p.s.  Rachael, did you get your $48 tip, as well as commission from product sales?  BTW, the two-star review isn't a reflection on Rachael's abilities as a colorist, but the treatment Mom and I received from the receptionist, as well as the lack of color fastness of Redken coloring products.  A colorist can only do so much w/ the products on hand, yes?  A coworker told me Goldwell products work well.  Anyone agree?",6,2,AnyNeHDwH06Vyk0fGJnyvA,6/22/2010,2,1,12,Home & Service

Management was easy-going and friendly both times I've gone to retrieve the pool key (last year and this year, around the same time-frame).  However, the gate's lock is always a hassle to unlock.  Both times I've let management know that the key, or lock, needs to be replaced.  The pool is irregular in shape, so it's hard to get a decent exercise.  I finally opted to just swim the perimeter.  (The pool at the complex I live in is geometric, but there is a straight path that allows for sufficient laps.)  Miramonte's pool is very deep (about 8 feet) in most areas, so what it lacks in distance, it makes up in endurance-- I find it harder to swim with that much more water underneath.  On my first time swimming there last week (Wed), the water temperature was almost as hot as that of their jacuzzi!  It's a good thing I didn't have much time to swim, or I probably would've had a worse headache than I ended up with when I finally surfaced.  I didn't have time to stop at the office to file a complaint, but I did mention it the following morning to personnel at the complex I live in, and by Friday, the water temperature was back to normal temperatures, which is around 82 degrees F at my complex's pool.

I checked on Yelp and Gabi came to my rescue!  Based on Gabi's and Karri's reviews, I did not need another referral to fall back on- if Duane was good enough for Gabi, then he was good enough for me!I called Duane on Monday hoping I could have him visit the house that afternoon, but I'd have been happy if he could see me as early as Thursday.

Not only did Duane attend to all the repairs in 90 minutes the next afternoon, but included in that time, he also assisted in choosing a garbage disposal at a nearby Home Depot to replace the one that wouldn't work anymore, despite his assumption that it was nothing more than a stuck penny or broken glass- this has happened once before.  I should add that I had him look into a second toilet tank that a housemate had complained about.  Where a disreputable repairman could have taken this opportunity to charge me for unneeded repairs, Duane revealed to me his honest and trustworthy nature in telling me that the tank didn't need any repairs done!  He was also more than happy to show me how to do future repairs myself and also offered to walk me through them via phone in the future, should I elect to go that route!  I agree with Gabi and Karri in that his fees are more than fair, and that he is a very amiable and approachable individual.With so many admirable facets, as well as all-around handyman and social skills, Duane is most definately a diamond!",10,5,ACd53dWltizkwWtOwytZBA,4/9/2009,5,3,7,Home & Service

We most likely will continue to be a tenant in San Francisco as our company enjoys the ease of transitioning into this kind of office and enjoys furnished office setup that Regus offers even though you're paying a premium price for those services.  And trust me, Regus will charge you for everything from the office phone (separate fees for the handset and actual phone line), internet access, black/color copies, scanning, mandatory kitchen fees, and garage parking (optional although fairly affordable here).  We initially locked into a year long lease and was at this Phoenix location for about two full years.  I didn't really have any major problems with this Phoenix location until I took over the management of our company's billing system.  When you initially sign the lease, you have to commit to how many phone handsets and internet lines you want.  You pay for these office features like it is an a la carte menu just like a restaurant.  What I was not thrilled about is that we eventually had to downsize our operations from 2 people to 1 person at this Phoenix location during our initial lease, and we were still forced to pay for two phone lines and two internet connections.  Keep in mind that the monthly total for a phone line and an internet connection amounts to about $200/month (and that does not include the long distance usage fee you incur on your phone) so it is a fairly expensive feature.  I figured that Regus would have been reasonable enough to help us out but it was stated in our original contract we are responsible for the fees so I guess they have a ""gotcha"" on that one.  But when we accidentally forget to cancel our lease, our lease got rolled over for another six months and we were still being charged internet/phone charges for two people when we obviously only have one person occupying the office!!!!  I feel Regus need to use some common sense and ensure that company's are only being charged for the amount of people that occupy the office; especially when it comes to an automatic renewal.  Sadly, this location does not act on the side of the tenants who occupy their facilities.  Talk about ensuring the client gets shafted.My second major gripe about this location is with center manager  Valinda Evans.  Since at the time our company in the US only had two employees and two offices, we felt it was more productive to have two people in the same Regus office (in San Francisco).  Therefore we decided to leave the Phoenix office unoccupied with three months left on our lease.  I understand that you have to abide to the terms of your lease but I referenced to Ms. Evans of our unique situation and it wasn't until three weeks later after my two e-mail inquiries that I received a response.  Three weeks is highly unacceptable when you have a situation where you are in a position to leave your Regus office unoccupied and notification is made to the center manager.    I would have liked a little bit of flexibility and perhaps be able to transfer our Regus financial obligation to our SF office or pay an early termination fee.  Anything reasonable would have been helpful but the only reasonable option I had was to ""take additional space and sign and new contract.""  She also added that ""there is really nothing that I can do unless you take additional space in another location.""   Wow, so not helpful.  I was not seeking to get out of our leasing obligation, just to find a way to make it a little more convenient so we do not let an office sit dormant for three months which was such a waste.  If you are considering this Regus space in downtown Phoenix, I would highly recommend seeking other office options.  Phoenix has plenty of real estate in downtown and it should not be too difficult to find a sufficient alternative.Tip: Regus will not notify you prior to the termination of your signed lease. If you fail to notify them for another extension or to leave all together, they will automatically renew your lease for something like six months so beware that you have to notify them a certain amount of months prior to the termination of your lease.",14,2,kVruF0kVWvobgiQQM_O4fQ,11/10/2011,1,2,11,Home & Service

This latest ownership and management team seems to be dedicated to keeping the complex upgraded and making it inviting to new residents. Having lived here over 7 years (the magic number?) I have seen many changes & improvements - some good, some not so good. These new management & maintenance teams appears to be working diligently to provide updates and aesthetically pleasing improvements to the front of the complex. ""Good marketing."" New trees, new desert plants, new paint, new signage and especially a new flag. Currently the leasing office & fitness spaces, along with the main pool area are being upgraded. They are closed for ""a few months.""  One of the near-by apartments (N121) is serving as the temporary leasing office.Along with the flutter of activity to improve and upgrade the front of the complex, there are still some hiccups that have been concerns for some time. I was preparing to update this review last week to praise the ""new"" landscape maintenance team. In the past they have cut the hedges & plants down to just barely sticks. All foliage (leaves, blossoms) was stripped bare. 1) Last week I had noticed that, although the plants were not allowed to get large, they actually were green and, even the oleanders had a few pink blossoms on them. By the next morning I heard the electric edge cutters stripping the plants bare once again. Now we have a bunch of sticks once again. The beautiful Mexican Bird of Paradise near my apartment has been broken back and stripped back so poorly so many times that I think it is permanently traumatized. (It should be trimmed back carefully once a year.) The new beauty of the front of the complex is not reflected in the back areas where the residents live. 2) We still need some ""Go slow"" ""10mph"" or ""Drive slowly"" signs throughout the complex. Garbage trucks, water delivery trucks, UPS, Fed-Ex, moving vans, fast cars, motorcycles, etc. all race through the small narrow parking areas. Folks out walking their dogs and residents backing out of their garages & parking spaces are all taking their lives into jeopardy daily.  Since we each are paying an extra $5 per month, this would be a nice way to spend some of that $60 annual parking lot charge.3) Lighting. Some dark areas need to have much better lighting. new lights are smaller than the old ones. The new management seems to be trying to create community through periodic events. The latest one was a Pool Party on a Saturday. Great idea, but it was only announced a couple of days before the weekend . . . . . and the weekend was Mother's Day weekend. I am sure many residents who might have attended to get to know their neighbors and the new management team had already made plans for that weekend. I certainly had already made plans.Yes, i do recommend this complex, but there are some caveats that I want others to know before they move in. The Tempe location is great, but nothing is perfect. The upgrades to the many floor plans are making the complex an even nicer place to live. But, I'd like to see more of a community feel and more input from residents who pay thousands a year to live here.VILLA BLANCO:  Just remember that residents spread the word through word of mouth, social media and, yes, YELP.  Both good and bad. And long term residents are financially a much better deal then constant turn-over.",6,3,tvpeoP_h1E_8PQAA4hMxBw,5/20/2017,3,2,45,Home & Service

Vanessa did offer to resend her ladies, but I didn't want to pay them more money to do a half ass job again. I was also disappointed with how they were supposed to show up in the morning, but were still at the house when we arrives late in the afternoon to drop off some items before our big move in. Also, there were 2-3 bottles of Windex and that was the only type of cleaner I saw when I arrived. I don't think Windex is considered a ""green"" cleaner...",0,0,cECeJ5N1xsX-7p3ltBScTQ,2/19/2015,1,0,-2,Home & Service

That certain someone was pissed off throwing things and slamming cabinets because I came too soon after the window measuring even though I explained to him I was leaving town and the manager said it was okay to come in with the picture of the measurements. BAD4. I had 2 sets of custom cut blinds that were available in store. Somehow the measurements were off on both of them 1/4 to 1/2 inch even though they were suppose to be cut the same VERY BAD5. When I came back in they realize that they had to cut new ones and replace them. I had no issues this time. GOOD6. I bought a washer/dryer. They don't do gas installation and you have to pay 100 dollars for someone to come out. This is not a big issue, but the guys that delivered it from lowe's did not carry it up the stairs instead they used a trolly and pulled it up dirtying the carpet. They also just left the washer sitting there and did not help with the installation. BAD7. I bought two storm doors online and they said it was in stock and ready for pickup. I arrived and they told me sorry we don't have them even though they were clearly in the back under a similar SKU number. They had messed up.

I had a 700 sq ft 2/1 for about $450/month or so. This apartment was both good and bad. The apartment itself was decent. True, it wasn't in that great of condition and some things really needed to be changed (the bathroom sink looked like someone took a sledgehammer to it and we also later discovered there was a bird's nest in the exhaust from our kitchen), but overall it was decent-especially for a first apartment. It was super cheap and that was what was important at that time. There was a lot of space in the apartment, but most of it was wasted on the hallway. The kitchen was so tiny I couldn't comfortably be in it at the same time as my boyfriend but had a TON of cabinets that were decently made and sturdy. A lot of things were pretty shoddily done though. For example, the cutout for the sliding doors of the closet in the main bedroom was not straight and correct and therefore, the closet doors never shut properly. I actually measured how far away the edge of the cutout was from the corner of the room and the number changed the farther up the wall it went. Obviously, someone didn't take the time to measure anything. The layout itself was interesting and not bad, but again- there was a lot of wasted space for the hallway. And the place was just generally kind of dirty and old. We lived on the first floor and right next to the entrance to the building. The area was not *that* great, so we did feel largely unsafe there. The parking lot where the dumpster is located is really badly lit and just generally scary and creepy. You just get some weird people by that area. And because it's right next to Centennial High School, you get stupid high-schoolers who hang out in the 3x5 foot area when you enter into the building who drink and smoke. (You also hear all the football games and marching band practices in case that bothers you. Personally, I kinda liked it since I went there myself). There was one time when I came home from a friend's house at night and there was some stoned dude sitting on the top of the stairs staring at me as I frantically tried to unlock the door to get inside my apartment. :o/We never had any problems with things not really working. The living room A/C would randomly stop and I had to get someone to help me with a light in the kitchen. And the pressure in the shower was way too much. It would spurt out so much water, that water would start to gather inside the tub around your feet because it couldn't drain fast enough. But otherwise, everything worked great! And thank god too, because I've read horror stories about maintenance.. What was horrible was the staff. I spoke with CPM representatives at all different locations in Champaign and they were all unprofessional and, frankly, not all that intelligent. I had issues with our previous manager more than once, before the new manager took over who seemed on the ball for the most part. Don't even bother paying for a parking spot, because someone will ALWAYS be in it. And when you call a tow truck to tow them away, they always leave before the tow truck gets there. Luckily, though, we could park alongside the complex on the street.Noise insulation was basically non-existent. We heard our neighbors upstairs constantly- especially when the new residents moved in who had about a billion kids who never seemed to go to school or anywhere. They had a party once where I swear they were jumping OFF a bed onto the ground right above our bedroom. It was midnight and whenever they would land, our light fixture would shake so violently, I thought it was going to fall down on us on the bed. I called the police twice, but I'm not sure if they ever showed up. Grounds upkeep was a joke. They came out and watered flowers and crap, but there was always trash all over the place, especially when the dumpster would overflow. The outside of the building was started to look dilapidated. When we moved out, we had to arrange and pay for the carpet to be cleaned and then give them evidence that we had cleaned it. They said that they needed time to be able to clean it as well, but what I've heard from others about conditions, I don't think they do anything. There was a big red sprayed stain that looked like dried blood on the ceiling in the master bedroom when we moved in. We could never get it out ourselves. Gross and highly disturbing. You'd think they would have painted over that if they actually did paint like they say they do. Also, trying to get our deposit back was a big frickin hassle. Me and my boyfriend moved to Austin, Texas so I couldn't go talk to them personally but had to basically harass/stalk them over the phone constantly. It took a few months before we finally got the check in the mail. Like I said, it was good for the price, but you get what you pay for.

But it seemed right to focus on the Mass Transit District of Champaign-Urbana, the bus system that keeps my life in order.  I moved a month ago to Chambana, and it has quickly become apparent that I do not live in Southern California any more.  The land is flat, the wind comes sweeping through, the place is smaller in scope, and I'm rapidly realizing that I'm not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky.Enter Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.There's no need for a parking permit when there are countless, continuously running lines covering the entire area.  My weekday mornings find me checking my house, looking through my backpack, making sure all my stuff is in order, before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the 13 Silver South Line to campus, which runs twice an hour.  If I'm worried about catching the bus, the MTD has a text messaging service, where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving.  Let me tell you, a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts. :)The website is unfortunately abbreviated (http://www.cumtd.com), but wonderfully comprehensive.  I've had generally great luck with the drivers on the 5, 10, 13, and 7, and I'm really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible, constant, reliable mass transit.  I'm slightly less worried about gas prices, as it's free for university students to ride the ever-present CUMTD system. :)In short, thank you so much, Chambana MTD for getting me where I need to go all the time, every time.",13,11,qgJP5-eu5gDIBqJiNwl18Q,9/19/2008,5,7,15,Home & Service

It was $50, which actually beat out the price at a Super 8 by $5.  Sold.I saw on the website that their front desk is only open until 11.  Since I would be arriving late, I called to ask about what would happen if I arrived after 11.  She said that there is a phone between two sets of doors where I could dial a certain number, and there would be a night attendant to check me in, but only if I had a guaranteed reservation.  So, that's good.I arrived around 10, so everything was fine in that regard.  The guy at the front desk was extremely polite.  I was also happy to see that he had long hair, pulled into a ponytail--not because it was pulled into a ponytail, but because management allows someone who's not 100% clean cut to work there.The hotel itself is dingy at best.  It's worn down and not clean looking at all.  The rooms are in much better shape, but they're definitely not the Ritz.  Each room has a very well-kept kitchenette, complete with a coffeemaker, some silverware, a dish drainer, and some plates and mugs.  There may have been a microwave.  The bathroom is similarly pleasant (I enjoyed a long soak in the deep tub).  Both areas have hardwood floors, which I thought was a nice touch.The rest of the room, however, left something to be desired.  It looked cheap in comparison.  The bedspread was shiny and maroon--you know what I'm talking about.  The bed itself was incredibly firm, but not dangerously uncomfortable.  The pillows were absolutely the worst part....they were soft like marshmallows, but not in a comfy way...more like, in an entirely unsupportive way.  The t.v. was small, there were few channels (except for Showtime) and the remote barely worked.  The walls were fairly thin, since I could hear people's coffeemaker's working at 6 a.m.  Also, they have a sheet saying that they only do refresh services every 7 days, more often if you pay for it--but they won't do the dishes.I know that, for $50, I should not really be complaining.  But ultimately, these 'suites' are supposed to be aimed at people who will be staying there for weeks or months at a time.

Despite the high-traffic intersection location, it was magically pretty quiet inside the apartment.  We could see the Capitol building from our kitchen dining room window.  There were lots of windows in our corner apartment for maximum cross-breeziness.  The apartment had beautiful wood floors, 1 1/2 bathrooms (one of which was located in my bedroom) and spacious bedrooms.  The kitchen had lots of cabinet space, but was a bit outdated looking, but that's not too rare in Madison.  Extra bonus?  Beautiful, well-maintained courtyard--with a pool!The management was unlike any other that I've encountered in Madison.  They were unbelievably responsive to any maintenance requests we had (and there were few, since the apartments were well kept).  On the morning of my move-in day, my refrigerator began to make a noise that sounded like an airplane taking off.  It didn't stop all day.  Because it was a Sunday and they couldn't get the parts they needed, they apologized profusely and told me they'd take care of it the next day.  I came home from work the following afternoon and....BRAND NEW REFRIGERATOR.  That's amazing.  Any time we had problems with sinks or toilets, they were there within a few hours to fix it.  The lady who ran the office (Kristie, I think her name was), was the most polite and friendly customer service person I've ever met.

One of the water pipes coming from upstairs was cracked (nice looking out, fucking home inspector) and the plumber recommended AFR to assess the damage.  I am sure he got a nice kickback out of it but I needed someone ASAP to get this on the right track and they were able to come in less than 30 minutes.  They ended up taking down half the ceiling and about 30% of the walls of the garage.  The guys then set up 3 industrial sized dehumidifiers downstairs and 3 upstairs which sat there for a week to ensure everything would be dry before repair could begin.

The view was okay facing the Strip, but the Strip was a long block away and the giganormous Planet Hollywood on the cross-street (Harmon Ave.) directly next to the tower was in some round-the-clock stage of construction.  (We happened to be there on opening night of PH, as well, so traffic was horrendous!)But I digress.  It was nice to have an actual balcony, although there was no outdoor furniture to sit on.  The interior of our simple, open square room was nice with dark wood and granite countertops in the kitchenette, which included a microwave, one-burner cool stovetop, half refrigerator, cookware, and utensils.  We also found lush king bedding, a clean and open bathroom with dual sinks, jacuzzi tub and separate shower all dressed in marble and granite.

Here we enjoyed lunch at 'wichcraft, which helped make up for not visiting Manhattan this year...and an incredible dinner at Seablue.  We also managed to squeeze in some spa treatments the morning of our departure.So why three stars?Service was spotty:  wonderful at times and downright rude at others.The computer systems seemed out of sync:  both my name and hubby's were supposedly in the system, but hubby was given a difficult time regarding services a couple times b/c they could not find him.  When they did find him, they did not apologize and simply continued to treat him as if he did not belong there.  Also, despite confirming a late check-out b/c of the spa treatments we had booked, we were both locked out of our room at the usual check-out time.The fragrance that funnels through the ventilation system caused allergies so intense that I was congested through dinner at Seablue and sneezing until I had a nosebleed.  I would prefer the hotels that claim to be smoke-free also be fragrance-free, but sleeping with the balcony door open helped.And that long walkway to get to the nightlife...well, you need to be prepared for it.  Many times we didn't ""go back upstairs"" b/c it was a hassle.  The Signature is a great place for privacy and business meetings, but if you want to partake of the Vegas scene, you probably would enjoy staying in the MGM Grand, where you still have easy access to the wonderful selection of MGM's 4- and 5-star Restaurant and its shows, or elsewhere right on the Strip.

Recently though, new properties have been emerging to offer an un-Vegas like experience.  No casino hotels.  No smoking hotels.  I have not stayed at many of these hotels (The Mandarin, Vdara), but my most recent Vegas stay was at The Signature at MGM Grand (which is business friendly and not like the mega casinos on The Strip).  The Signature is filled with spacious condos that are complete with kitchenettes, whirlpool bathtubs and (in some rooms) balconies.The Signature is located in the back of the MGM Grand.  It is attached to the MGM Grand via many airport-like automated walkways.  The hotel has very limited services.  There is a small lounge as well as an order-at-the-counter cafe.  For more dining options or expensive convenience store items, you are going to need to make the long trip to the MGM Grand.  This hotel does have its own pool as well as a 24-hour fitness center though it was difficult getting an open machine in the morning.The rooms at The Signature are nice.  The decor is up-to-date enough and the rooms are comfortable and very spacious.  Rooms come with kitchenettes, a big living area and a table (this creates a great pre-going out spot).  Rooms are also equipped with safes.  Room temperature was nice.There were a few minor negatives in the room.  It was difficult turning the TV off (it kept turning itself back on).  There were some missing items like no hotel directory to provide information on location of business center, fitness center and such.  No laundry bag either.Bathrooms are very big here.  Each room comes with a huge whirlpool tub as well as a big glass shower.  Unfortunately, the shower head had a very concentrated blast and not the widespread rain-like shower head many hotels are now featuring.  Getting the perfect water temperature in the shower was not easy either.Service was fine.Room rates at The Signature are typically higher than the MGM Grand, but they are not too expensive when compared to other similar properties along The Strip and it is less expensive than several of the upscale resorts on The Strip.I think how much you like The Signature is going to depend on what you are looking for in a Las Vegas hotel.  If you are looking for a good value room that is big and great for gatherings (as well as not next to a smoky casino), The Signature is a really good option.  If you want a more themed hotel as well as something that is convenient and a quick walk to the many other Las Vegas casinos, The Signature is probably not where you want to stay.I personally like having some of the niceties of The Signature like the big rooms and the non-smoking property, but given how far it is from The Strip, I would much rather stay at the Renaissance for a more business-like and less Vegas-like hotel experience, where I am getting the lower room rate as well as earning Marriott Rewards points.Complimentary valet parking is offered.  If you want complimentary self parking, you will need to park at the MGM Grand's parking structure, which is a very long walk to The Signature.",21,11,5iL-XZulVa0myNa5gK6eeQ,1/12/2014,3,7,80,Home & Service

When I moved in, a bonus was that it was a brand new property, now it's falling down and apart (cheap construction?). The residents are discourteous (loud music, don't pick up their dogs' feces, throw trash everywhere, their kids are often running around unsupervised, etc.) , visitors and/or people with multiple cars take up parking spaces without a decal, loud people in the pool/hot tub/workout rooms at all times of night, etc. and management does NOTHING. Any complaints are written down in a SPIRAL NOTEBOOK and from what I can tell are never followed-up on with any recourse to those that break leasing rules. I have been thoroughly disappointed by my residency here and have chosen to look elsewhere. I am counting down until my lease is up. In my research, I have found that the majority of properties in the area at or above AC's standard have rental rates at least a 100.00 LESS than they are still charging at AC! I am moving into a complex (approx. same age, quiet neighborhood, much more convenient highway access, positive online reviews ;) within a few miles and getting TWO BEDROOMS for the price I am currently being charged for ONE.  When I made the request to have my rental rate reviewed due to the competing market, of course, AC said no. It makes NO SENSE for me stay somewhere that is not even a pleasant place to live while being charged more than I have to be. This is the THIRD year in which there has been no decrease in my rent, therefore, it is probably safe to assume that AC does not care about loyalty AT ALL. They provide NO INCENTIVES to their residents.  There is no wonder you often see ""failure to pay rent"" notices on doors (again, indicating the types of residents AC may have routinely). It is unfortunate because nobody LIKES to move if they don't have to, but at this point in time management does not make it worth it to stay.",14,2,u68Ph5ZeVAhH1E8NJFsX7A,2/2/2012,2,0,-7,Home & Service

When the new management took over I really was wishing they can do a better job but instead I'm only getting this none stop nightmare almost monthly. Starting from September 2016, there was issue with my rent payment and long story short I got $100 credit in my account  and that ended up missing later on with no explanation(feels like they stole it) this apartment complex uses the weakest blind possible and when it's windy outside and I have my window open, the blinds break off from the top like crazy, since I moved in in July 2016, more than half of my blinds broke off and I never reported it cause it never bothered me much and I have a busy schedule so I just left it alone till October 2016 I finally decided to report it and have them fix it so I don't have sunlight blinding my eyes just by sitting in my living room. They came in to take a look at it while I was at work, and I received this call on November 1st from Trixi at the leasing office telling me to call back, I called after work and she was telling me the technician said the damaged was due to my cat and they will have to charge me for all the broken blinds. I found it unbelievable considered the blinds are broken off from the top and my cat is always locked in the cage during the night I'm not watching them and yes they do jump up to the window but it's physically impossible for him to break the blinds from the top, I explained to Trixi and I told her I'm not responsible for it and I'm not gonna pay for those blinds so she told me she will have to check with the technician and the manager and would give me a call back, so I went home and found out they've already put the new blinds up without letting me know. I had a very bad feeling already considered they told me they are charging. 3 days later I still haven't received any follow up so I decided to go in to talk to them in person, this time I got to speak with this older lady I forgot her name but I think she was the manager that gave me the worst attitude. I went in because first of all, I only put in the work order because the wind broke my blinds and I wasn't expecting any payments going out of my pocket, second if they called me and tell me to call back to discuss about this payment, I would assume it's them trying to see if I'm willing to pay or not; with them repairing the blinds without me authorizing the charges is just wrong. So I told the lady they can not charge me the money I didn't authorize, and she just kept on arguing with me calling me negligent to leave the window open and break the blinds. Excuse me for opening the window living on the third floor and needed some air coming in my apartment, we stood there and going back and forth for nearly 15 minutes listening to her bullshit, for one, I was trying to talk rationally and logically to her and she kept interrupting me was already highly unprofessional. I tried to talk some sense out of her and all she could tell me was ""we are not responsible for the breakage, you are because of your neglect."" Finally I was done cause she was obviously not listening to a word I was saying and I told her go ahead and take the blinds back, they didn't get my permission to fix it with a charge, they got the permission to come in and fix it yes but not with a charge. They should have let me know before they touched it if they were going to charge me. So now I feel like anything I report to them I have to be very careful cause they might just try to rip me off again. week later I went in to report my microwave broke and I spoke with Trixi again, she told me the blinds weren't charged. So here I was getting 2 different stories and had no idea what was the truth. Mid November I reported my microwave and waited for almost 3 weeks, no one showed up so I was out of microwave for nearly 3 weeks. Finally I got some time to call them again and it's the older lady again answering the phone this time she told me she didn't see any work order, so apparently I reported it and they just forgot to key in the system. she then promised me it'll be fixed with in a day or 2. Still no one has stopped by to fix it till 2 weeks later and no one bother to call me to tell me what's going on. I basically went without a microwave for nearly 2 months. Last week January 28th I got a note on my door saying they got a ""notification"" that my renter's insurance has been cancelled and need me to turn in my paperwork for the proof of my insurance, just another bullshit they are putting on me again. More to the stories but I'm reaching the word limit so good luck to people who try to move in",2,0,X1IvYUFTN08MO6Is3JtMrw,1/31/2017,1,0,-27,Home & Service

A ton of new flooring.  Specifically, we had decided to install new laminate - which we didn't actually get here at Carefree Carpets, but that they would install for us - new carpet and new vinyl.  Plus new carpet for the room over the garage.All in all, it was a bunch of new flooring.We actually worked with David first to see if we could come up with something for the laminate (or some other option), and we looked at a ton of different options.  Unfortunately none of them really worked for us.  The problem is that we had several colors of wood - white, oak and a couple different cherry-like colors.  That means we needed something that had a variety of colors in them.  Not circus colors, mind you, but perhaps a variation in color, rather than a single color like an oak.Generally this meant a real wood, but that would have been too thick.  So we decided to keep looking.  We ended up also looking at Lumber Liquidators and a few other flooring places, but settled on a variety from Ollie's - not one of the closeouts, but one they keep in stock - and had Carefree Carpets install it for us.  In fact, they had to install some of it twice, because one of the other contractors dropped a tool on it and scratched it up pretty badly.  Both times they did a fine job.They even installed transitions - the piece that matches up different styles of flooring - and quarter rounds (shoe moulding) that was stained to match the laminate flooring that we had picked out.  Is it perfect?  Probably not.  But it looks awfully sweet.  Even the cable guy was in the other day and mentioned that it looks nice.  The cable guy?  Seriously?  Family, friends, sure.  But the cable guy?The carpet was a bit easier, but it was complicated by wrapping things around stairs, which can be a bit of a pain.  Still, it turned out great.  Perhaps the biggest surprise was the sheet vinyl in the laundry room, which looks like tile, and turned out better than we could have imagined.Once we were done, the old bathrooms (two ceramic tile and one vinyl) looked so bad we had to use some of our old ceramic tile and get those updated.  We had Carefree Carpets do this too.  Turned out great.Now why are they called ""Carefree Carpets"" when they also install laminate, tile and vinyl?  I have no idea.

Back in the day, you could actually window shop for things, but this is only in certain places in certain cities - and then perhaps only at certain times of year when the displays were changed out for something interesting. If you are actually shopping for windows, it is much, much worse.Champion is one of those names that you likely see about everywhere if you are in the market for windows. They send out flyers to everyone on your street. They advertise in the paper. They put ""coupons"" in the remodeling flyers. They have a booth at the remodeling shows. So we had them out. And their windows are not cheap, by any means. The one saving grace is that they do offer a lifetime warranty - on both parts and labor - and they have at least been around long enough that they will likely be there when you go to ask for service under said warranty.What I would suggest is not buying their windows at full price. Multiple times a year (maybe constantly) they run sales. Within those sales periods, they run other sales that are even better, such as ""buy X, get Y free"". Wait for those. Then be prepared to walk away, much as if you are car shopping. If you happen to be a previous customer, you can likely use this to your advantage and get the same pricing on a new batch of windows (hopefully your prior pricing was worth getting again).The windows themselves? Totally functional. They look nice and we can see through them. I don't know that we could ask for much more in a window.",5,1,JIgUbUnP-AuGIE0EDLojeg,3/6/2013,3,1,18,Home & Service

Or a few dozen.We ultimately decided to give into the monster and settled on Bank of America.  I mean if we're going to have a local presence, might as well have the biggest, right?I was in this area, so stopped in, which was good, because their other branches are usually slammed.  This one typically isn't.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's all the dancing statues of liberty from the tax place across the street.Setting up the business account wasn't hard.  Neither were the personal accounts, really.  The hardest part was navigating the endless suggestive sell process - do you want a debit card with that?  How about an extra account for your dog?  Finally managed to get it all done though.Then the real difficulty began: Transferring money.  It's been decades since I used a bank (vs. a credit union), so I don't know if the problem is one of being at a bank or at Bank of America specifically, but they want to hold everything.  Not reliably, however.The first person said that under a particular amount would go through.  So I get a cashiers check for that amount.  It's held until the next day.  I can deal with that.  Then I get another.  That one is held for three days.  Huh.  After that goes through, I get another.  That one is held for a week.  So I set up an online transfer.  This only allows a tiny amount to be transferred directly from the other account directly into the Bank of America account.  What a pain.Yes, I could get one whopping check for the entire amount - but what I want to know is why a cashiers check from another financial institution (again: not a personal check) is held at all, much less for varying amounts of time.  Because I need to pay bills, I can't transfer the entire amount at once, and I'd like to get as much as possible moved, while retaining access to my money.  But they don't like to allow that (this doesn't appear to be the fault of this location in particular).Finally, it seems that they didn't order the debit cards for the accounts like they said they would.  Had that done at another branch, who also let us know that we could get our pictures on them.  Didn't even know it was an option from this branch (this is the fault of this location).

It was so bad it felt as if they were trying to hide something.After turning in all the requested documentation I did not hear ANYTHING from them until one Wednesday I get a call saying my loan is ready to close, when can I do it, this Friday, this Saturday, or Monday? I told them I couldn't close on any of the days they offered nor could I do it next week as I would be out of town on work. Keep in mind, no one has called to review closing documents with me, to ask if I needed any explanation on the final costs, etc.The ""closing coordinator"" then informed me that my rate lock would expire next Friday and that she would have to talk to my loan officer, Bryan Partridge. That is when the high pressure, hard sales come into play. Bryan calls me and tells me that they would need to charge an 1/8 of a point if I wanted to extend the rate lock and that the rate lock had already been extended one week. WHAT?! I had never up to this point requested a rate lock extension, when did this happen?! ""Oh, we [roundpoint financial] had to extend it one week because we made a mistake in the processing of your loan,"" Bryan tells me. If they had not required that extra week, I could have closed when I was not working, had plenty of time to review and ask questions about the closing costs and documents, but no, I need to accommodate them, no accommodation for the customer. Geez, I should have charged them an 1/8 point! I tried to explain to Bryan that I will be working next week, so I will be too busy to go over the documents, etc. He keeps on reminding me that the rate lock has already been extended a week and I have to keep on reminding him that I didn't request that extension. Bryan says he will need to discuss this and he will call me back. He calls back and says if he can get the closing documents to me for me to review by Friday would that be okay, because he ""wants to work with me and accommodate [my] needs."" Yeah what a crock of $h!t. Of course, he doesn't get me the documents by Friday, instead he gets them to me Monday evening. Of course the documents are as clear as mud. Different figures and sums in different formats (HUD documents vs roundpoint documents) so trying to figure things out was very difficult.I was working in AZ and I had to work past 3 pm everyday so by the time I got off work, roundpoint financial was already closed on the east coast, so no one to answer any questions. I would email my ""senior"" loan officer, Bryan, but if and when he responded, he would often not answer all my questions or answer them very vaguely, e.g. ""we already discussed that."" I did get a closing requirements letter from their closing coordinator. On that letter, it was clearly stated I had the right to rescind the loan after closing, this made me feel a little better. That didn't last long. When it came time to finally sign the documents with the notary, it was a hot, sticky mess. Supplemental documents that were initially given to me to review, were not in the actual closing documents for me to sign and vice versa. The notary wanted me to sign documents that were not initially given for me to review. I told the notary I could always rescind, but the she, the notary, has to inform me that I could not since this was an investment property. I think that is p!$$ poor when the notary, who doesn't know anything about the closing costs, has to explain the details of the loan to me. Overall, if you do choose to work with this company be very cautious and suspect of everything they do. Do not be afraid to ask questions, demand answers, scrutinize numbers, or even walk away. I would avoid Bryan Partridge. Even though he is a ""senior"" loan officer, I think that means he is good at high pressure sales and avoiding questions.",45,0,by3ev4Q2PkCBK3bRZWaXgg,10/12/2013,1,2,-23,Home & Service

It's nicely laid out, if a bit crowded, with custom furniture, ready made pieces, candles, bedding, jewelry, cards, paintings, and beautiful home goods. I even spied some vintage chandeliers and suitcases in the mix! There are two levels to explore so be ready to spend a bit of time in the store searching through all the treasures. While I really enjoyed the beautiful furniture and fabrics, there were a few extra bright spots worth mentioning: -Alexander Scott has a great selection of jewelry. Very impressive and uber affordable. This was a shocker to me. Pretty cuffs from $25-$50, necklaces from $40-$100, etc. All sorts of styles, materials and tastes. -There's a fantastic collection of handmade greeting cards (on both levels). Many of these items are crafted by local and regional artists. My favorite? A card that simple read, ""You are the Milli to my Vanilli. Girl you know it's true.""

This was the Ohio based branch that made my move and is the one that I am reviewing.-------This review represents the culmination of several months of wrangling with one of the worst companies I've ever had the DISpleasure of working with, and one of the most painful customer experiences that I've ever had in my life here on earth. I will break the review into a couple segments for clarity.This is a painful review to write, and I will make sure this review goes to both Angie's List and Yelp as well as Movers.com.Bullet Points:Overpromise, Underdeliver. High Pressure Sales tactics. Poor customer service and follow up. I quote: ""You'll be satisfied with our service. We'll make you happy. We're very proud of our Angie's list B+ rating""The Plan:Day 1: 8-12 am arrival, half day to pack.Day 2: Transport to target cityDay 3: 8 am delivery.Actual:Day 1 arrival: 4:30 pm. Stopped work at 10:30 pmPromised to restart packing at 8:00 am and finish by 10:30 the next day.Much wrangling with the operations part of their service who had very different sets of plans for us. Changes in pricing. Insurance offered. We ultimately took it due to the large numbers of disconcerting elements to the service. Call backs were not performed - we had to call them ourselves to finish conversations with the company. The team hadn't eaten all day, and were very fatigued upon arrival, so we fed them.Day 2 arrived at 8:20, finished packing 3:00 pm, after multiple push backs.My parents, in their 70s were to wait at target site. The personnel promised to be mindful of my parents age and assured us that they would update us if there would be further delays. At least to take care of my parents.Day 3: Texted to get information from personnel, and were told they'd be 20 minutes late since they had to get breakfast (reasonable). 9:30, still no arrival. Once they arrived, it became clear that they would not be able to complete the task themselves (these were not large, muscular workers) and we hired several additional workers to help them finish the job - with the help of building management.It is impossible to overstate how much we tried to inform the company the particulars of the new site, which were not internally conveyed to their moving team.Damages to several appliances and statues noted on arrival. Claims filed a little while after to their claims department. The claims were denied, but their email was sent to the wrong address and we never received follow up until we pursued the matter ourselves. They later told us they received a bounced email, but didn't bother to check the email address they had used to send to us.At any rate, all claims were denied as they don't cover appliances or statues - which was not made clear to us at time of purchase of insurance. What's the point of insurance if it doesn't cover anything?Phone calls from management were non-existent.Summary:Horrid experience.

Finally, something with new finishes, open layouts, high ceilings, a nice walk-able location, and still has some old-school charm and architecture.The staff is fantastic, friendly, professional and helpful. They've worked hard to ensure that I'm happy, and are quite responsive to issues. I had some noise problems with HVAC that required substantial trial and error, but they were persistent until it was resolved.The neighbors are friendly, fun, and... neighborly. Its nice that the management often has social events for the tenants so you can meet each other.Utilities are pretty inexpensive. I have a 2br, and the highest the heating/electric bill went (with Ethical Electric Green Energy) in January was 740kWh, about $100. Not bad! Water is fixed and included with rent as a fee.However, the building is not without some quirks and issues:* There aren't lights where there really ought to be - like in a dark, isolated hallway closet where you can't see your clothes.  Or above where the dining room table should go! * The floors aren't real hardwoods, they're cheap laminate. At least I don't have to worry about scratching them.* The paint on the walls somehow marks with the slightest scratch or brush up against it. Its like they put on a single coat, and the paint has carbon or something to show wherever it was touched.* The elevator has a beautiful glass wall in it, yet the windows to the exterior are covered in either bird poop or concrete droppings. Visitors are like ""OOOOhhh!"" followed by ""Eeeeewwww"". Its kind of embarrassing. * The place is locked up like Fort Knox. Its nice that it is secure, but holy cow, its super annoying if you're trying to host a party. You or somebody have to go down the elevator to let somebody in EVERY TIME. There is no way to buzz somebody up. Going from the lobby entrance to your unit requires at least 3 badge swipes. Garage to the unit requires FIVE badge swipes! (Garage entrance, garage vestibule, lobby vestibule, lobby, elevator). I curse out loud every time I have to walk in carrying something. Really, they need to make a real security desk in the lobby.* Lots of construction noises due to East Liberty Transit Center renovations. This usually starts around 7:30am every day. This isn't in the property's control, but something to consider about location. With East Liberty projects scheduled all around us, I don't expect outside noise to be getting better within the next few years.* The pet fee is insanely high. 1/2 a month rent for a cat?! I paid it, because I love my cat, but there is no way she could possibly do that much damage to an apartment for any amount of time. It isn't even refundable. Silly.Overall, I'm happy with the place and the problems above are most definitely ""first world problems"", but for the price premium that we pay for a luxury apartment, I expect a little more. Until The Odeon, Eastside III, and Bakery Square 2.0 projects are completed, this or a few private loft condos are basically your only option for a contemporary place in the neighborhood.",4,1,xHxdxyCkZbfoTRzh_wX6yg,2/5/2014,4,1,26,Home & Service

Packing went way over the expected time, past my management companies hours, at which point they were going to charge me extra. Movers started rushing, being careless. They left many items behind, completely didn't pack a closet. I ended up spending several hours moving stuff they missed. Movers got into a verbal altercation at the moving truck with each other. I had to walk away because I thought they may start physically fighting. They crammed stuff completely wall-to-wall in the elevator, knocked off the protective mats. At the destination, the movers tried moving the truck while the ramp was attached, and ended up hitting a neighbor's truck with the ramp. Amazingly, it didn't appear to cause damage. Again, I had to walk away because I just couldn't watch them. At the destination, the movers requested that I unload a wardrobe box so they could re-use it (seriously?) I complied, and when I came back downstairs, I noticed the strong smell of gas in the kitchen. One of the movers had bumped the knob on the range, left it pouring gas into the kitchen, and NOBODY NOTICED!? THE MOVERS NEARLY BLEW UP MY NEW HOUSE! Liquor bottles were packed upside-down, leaking everywhere. Water left in a kettle when it was packed - everything was wet. Original canvas paintings were placed in a wardrobe box, no protection from each other, and damaged due to the corners of each other. Basically all but one of my lamps were broken. Broken glasses, bowl, missing parts to my keyboard stand &amp; coffee table, scratched my desk, damaged the apartment walls. A wall clock went completely missing. None of the boxes were labeled, so at the destination, everything ended up on the first floor except for wardrobe boxes - many of which didn't actually contain clothes. I was moving boxes up and down constantly during unpacking. On the plus side, I was reimbursed for the lost/damaged items. It took a month and a half to get the check, but I did.

My move from start to finish was riddled with mistakes, some minor and some major, and it made my move from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia all the more stressful. Allegheny Valley Transfer (AVT; via Allied) was unprofessional, unable to communicate (with me or to each other), and unwilling to make things right when they made mistakes. The following is a detailed account of what happened.I first called Allied and explained to them that I lived in a 3-bedroom house but had roommates and the move would be one of the three bedrooms, that I had very little in the way of common area furniture and any of the things I had in the common areas were minimal and could be put in about 5 boxes max. They said great, they'd have people come to estimate what the cost would be, and we set up an appointment.The estimators come, and they seem surprised because they have been told that it was 3-bedroom house but none of the other details (Mistake 1). But otherwise, it's fine, they carry on and I point out all of things that are mine that I'm taking with me. I tell them I want all the bells and whistles: I want them to pack my things, I want them to move my things, I want them to unpack my things. The estimators also say great, and tell me that I don't even have to take things out of my drawers, they'll take care of all of that. The only thing I have to do is keep the things that are mine in the common area in one space so that it'll be easier for them to distinguish between what stuff is mine versus my roommates. Reasonable, of course, and I think great, that's what I want. They give me an estimate.They send me the paperwork the next day and ask when I want them to pick up my things, when I say, well how long will it take to be delivered? They say, ok tell us a range of days you want it to be delivered and we'll tell you when it should be picked up. I tell them Mon, June 19 - Wed, June 21. They say, we can do a 5-day spread instead, so Mon, June 19 - Fri, June 23. I say that's fine, and they say they'll pick up Thurs, June 15. Perfect, I say, and I book my flight accordingly (originally planned on Sunday night but decided Saturday night based on price).Two days before they're supposed to pick up my stuff, I realize there's no time window for pick-up, so I call and ask and they say they'll have the movers call me closer to then, but that the earliest it would be is 12pm because they have other pick-ups that day. Ok, that's a pretty big window but fine.They never called, but the night before my move, I stayed up late putting together some of my things from the common areas and planned to get up and do a couple more hours of work before the movers arrived. The next morning I woke up at 8:50am to pounding on my door. They were over 3 hours early from the earliest time they estimated (Mistake 2). Turns out they were also never told about packing my things so they had to scrounge up any boxes they had in the truck (Mistake 3) -- thankfully, I did not have much stuff for them to pack, but they moved incredibly slowly, at one point one of them even took a 10 minute phone call followed by a bathroom break (Mistake 4).Because a 5-day spread is a long time, I figured the movers would have a better idea of when they'd arrive by now, so I asked: Do you have a better idea of when I'll receive my stuff? Yes, they say, SATURDAY, June 17 in the morning (Huge Mistake 5)!! I had already booked my flight and my new apartment did not do weekend moves (issues with freight elevators etc.).By this point, I am livid, but after a ton of hassle and back and forth with my apartment building and AVT, I had to change my flight at my own cost so that I could arrive by the time the movers would; otherwise, I would have to wait 2 weeks to get my stuff! AVT was unapologetic and even unwilling to provide any discounts for the major inconvenience. Finally, I got the apartment building to ok a 4-5pm freight elevator time, and I called both AVT and the actual movers to make sure they would make it at that time.When I arrived in Philadelphia, I cleaned my place then went to Target, planning to buy some things before the movers arrived in a few hours. They arrived WITHOUT NOTICE at 1:20pm, expecting to be let in (Mistake 6). By the end of it, I was so fed up that I did not even point out that they were also supposed to unpack for me (Mistake 7).Also, it's been a week and a half and I have yet to receive a receipt (though I know my credit card was charged) and I have yet to receive a claims form (Mistakes 8 and 9), which I need because they broke my mirror frame (ha, Mistake 10).My entire experience with Allegheny Valley Transfer was miserable, and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

There are curio cabinets, amazing reclaimed ceiling tile mirrors, plush chairs, fantastic lamps and a bevy of side tables, wall hangings and of course, dining room tables. The service is impeccable -- sweet, helpful women who know every item in their shop and are just as excited to help you shop as you are to find perfect item. The taste level in this store is impressive, as well. As a bonus, they have a few displays of fun, affordable jewelry ranging from delicate to super funky. Take your time to pick through this shop and enjoy yourself while doing it -- I certainly did!",4,3,C9IWXFRPL1LZDltcSW-A4g,10/28/2014,5,1,37,Home & Service

The suites are housed in a turn of the century victorian house converted into apartments and conveniently located off bus lines to Downtown.

I wanted a properly insured and licensed mover. Think they all are? Guess again. You need to go here to look up movers: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/transportation/movers/So, I talked to Barry on the phone, and he got someone to send me a quote. It was reasonable, and similar to what was listed on the website, with reasonable upcharges for my upgrades. Wait, climbing a lot of stairs isn't an upgrade, is it? You know what I'm saying here. The manager (Alan?) was on it. Though I must admit that guys with neck tattoos scare the hell out of me. I mean. Neck. Tattoo. That like, hurt, right? Anyway....Alan had one. But hey, if he's tough enough to take a neck tatt, I guess he's tough enough to lift my crappy IKEA dresser. Also, bonus: there was no mocking of my IKEA crap. Unless you count MY mocking my IKEA crap. There was some of that.Anyway, as a previous reviewer commented, a three-hour delivery window is a little annoying, but it worked out and I ended up using that extra time to clean and up the odds of recouping my deposit!And once the guys got there, they just didn't stop. Boom, boom, boom, done.They also did not complain about a couple of little curveballs that came up. For example, some jerk complained about the location of the moving truck. It was in a perfectly fine location, and the only car blocked in was mine! And the elevator at my new place turned out to be annoyingly small. In fact, Alan's attitude was SO calm and positive, we tipped heavily, and I feel good about that. He rocked! And his crew rocked, too.This is the first move I've ever had where nothing got seriously damaged or broken. And seriously, I think you should just expect one thing to get thrashed in any move. This exceeded my expectations.I would definitely hire Strong Young Movers again. And I'd request Alan again. I hope his name was Alan, because it would be weird if some stranger named Alan showed up. Especially if he had a neck tattoo. Thanks guys!! And thanks to you Yelpers for helping me find Strong Young Movers!",3,1,v05oXrRK_KDUBbOLEk_jfA,3/22/2010,5,2,-14,Home & Service

(Side note - Time Warner Cable and Time Warner have been completely separate, unaffiliated companies for almost four years.  Please don't insult the media company Time Warner by referring to Time Warner Cable as Time Warner).  Anyways, the only local cable option is Comporium, but their prices seemed high, and they also had a lot of additional fees when everything switched to digital.  We decided to go with Dish Network, and for the most part we have been happy.  It was my first experience with satellite, and overall, it's been better than cable.  The price of the service is reasonable, but there are some fees added onto the $29 offers you see (they are usually clearly represented though).  The lease of the DVR is free; however there is a $6 fee for the DVR service (usually waived for the 1st year or two as part of a promotion).  Regional sports networks are an extra $6 per month (Fox Sports).  However, even when everything has been added up, it's still slightly cheaper than cable.  The best thing however is that we have had it for 3 years and our rate has NEVER INCREASED!We had one issue where our DVR overheated and we lost everything recorded on it.  It was partly our fault as they are CPU's and need air circulation and we had some small items obstructing it.  They replaced it without and issue.  The service went out often at first but they came out and readjusted the dish and it's been fine since.  The customer service has been good.  Most often I have spoken to people in the US but occasionally will get an offshore rep.  We temporarily fell behind on our bills and they were very good about it.  On the few times I've had to call them I have not had to wait more than 5 minutes (and usually not at all).  As far as outages due to weather, they are few and far between.  It either has to be downpouring or snow falling (which accumulates in the dish and blocks the signal) for the signal to go out.  If you're worried about a 2 year contract, don't be.  If you are unsatisfied with the service, they are not holding up their end of the contract and you can cancel.  My main problem with Dish is that NBC Sports (formerly Versus and before that the Outdoor Life Network) is on their top tier.  It's a little too expensive so we don't get it.  Right now, however, they have a bunch of Starz and Encore movie channels for free for a year as part of an anniversary.Overall, we have been much happier than Dish than with cable.  I cannot compare it to Comporium, but we have them for internet and they are good.  I'm just not sure I'll ever go back to cable.",3,0,5Hc2tGDYC6NaTmZ0QBL3Tw,1/14/2012,4,0,8,Home & Service

I thought that company's price was a little high and I am unsure if they are even still around.  I really dislike calling the big AC places that have TV commercials because they often are commissioned and try to sell you unnecessary stuff,  It's the same reason I take my car to a local mechanic.  Anyway, our AC just did not seem to be working as efficiently as it should, so I gave NASCAIR a call based on Yelp reviews and a friend's recommendation.  They sent a guy out who checked the Freon levels, temperatures, main unit, and coil.  Everything was functioning normally and the Freon was only about a half pound low.  He said that the maximum temperature an AC unit in the Charlotte area can handle is 93 degrees and that an AC unit can only cool to a maximum of 20 degrees.  With the hotter than usual weather this summer, it was normal for our AC to be running constantly and not cooling below 80 degrees during the day.  Since the weather will be cooling soon, he said he could install the Freon (which is expensive) or wait until the springtime and have them check it again.  I chose the latter and will definitely be giving these guys a call.  Total price for this thorough service call where I was not even attempted to be upsold anything?  85 bucks.  If you need HVAC service, give this company a call.  It is great to know that places like this that don't have to put thousands of dollars into stupid commercials still exist.  Oh, and the price for the other company that replaced the coil before?  Not so bad considering the price of Freon at the time.",4,1,XhpDbaD6Cv0cfV8iEJc7bw,9/19/2015,5,0,0,Home & Service

That customer was not clear as to what part of the property she wanted fenced in. If you tell the crew one area on one day and then change your request to include additional area to be fenced in at a later visit the price will naturally change. It's not fair to hold the fencing company responsible for that. Now, on to our experience with Gateway Fencing, as actual customers. I'm currently in my third home with both preceding homes having been flipped with my husband and I serving as default general contractors. As a result, we have extensive experience with subcontractors. Browse my Yelp profile to see some of the horrific experiences I've had w/ fence companies. As a result of all of this, I know how to spot a good contractor, particularly a good fencing contractor. Lamar Conner is one of the BEST contractors in the Charlotte area, period. He is 100% ethical, honest, and honorable. We 1st met him about a year ago when we had 7 different fencing companies come out and quote us for a 6 foot wooden privacy fence to be put up around our backyard (1.5 acres, wooded at the time of quote gathering). Some of the quotes were absolutely outrageous (the worst being over 20K!). Lamar's quote was totally reasonable and my husband and I just got a good vibe from him...he's a super nice guy, you'll see when you meet him. Foolishly, we elected to go with another contractor who essentially made us a deal that was too good to be true (see my review for scam artist Mike Struble AKA Mark Williams of Splinters Construction AKA Vision Wood Works). We liked Lamar more and had a good ""gut feeling"" about him so we asked him if he could match the aforementioned lower quote. He did his best to match it but told us that going any lower would be virtually impossible, given supply costs, etc. He also warned us that Mike Struble may be a scam artist, based on the quote Struble had given us. Throughout this entire exchange Lamar remained friendly, helpful, and respectful. It was clear to us that he really just wanted the best for us. He told us to come back to him if we ran into any problems. Of course we did run into problems with Mike Struble who stole 6K from us. We used a credit card to pay Struble, so, after several months of investigation the credit card company gave us our 6K back and now they're suing Struble (yay!). We re-approached Lamar with this information and he graciously agreed to honor the original quote he'd given us! Just to be clear...Lamar Conner (owner of Gateway Fencing) agreed to a rock bottom price to install our fence...a quote that he gave us nearly a year earlier to compete with another quote that had been given by a scam artist. Lamar could have easily told us to buzz off and that the original quote was absurdly low and that he could not honor it, but he did not do that. Instead, he brought in his incredibly professional crew and built a masterpiece on our property. Lamar Conner and the crew of Gateway Fencing are artisans...true craftsman. They take great pride in their work and it shows. Our property was so difficult at the time of fence installation; essentially an overgrown forest (previous owner's idea of ""landscaping""). Lamar's crew took down and removed medium sized trees, small and medium sized overgrown shrubs, and removed random blocks of cement left by the previous owner). There were a few scraggy old box woods not even close to the fence line that they took down and removed for us a courtesy just because we wanted them removed! We hired a tree professional to drop a a massive quantity of huge dead and dying trees (80+ feet tall) and Lamar's crew patiently worked around that project. They took weeks off when we requested and then came right back when we asked them to. To say that Lamar customized our job and provided us with concierge service would be an understatement! Our tree remover left the cut up (massive) rounds on our property and Lamar and his crew spent a day helping us remove them...just because! Lamar knew what a jam we were in with all this wood and literally devoted a full day, a big bobcat, and two excellent crew members to the task of removing about 15 tree's worth of wood from our backyard...at no additional charge. Because we worked with Lamar, his crew, and communicated with his office staff, over so many months we really got a chance to get to know them. These are the nicest people you'd ever want to work with and they're all so professional. These are absolutely the type of contractors/skilled workers you'd want to have on your property. Just recently, many months after the completion of our fence, Lamar's crew came out to answer a question I had about one of our gates. They don't blow you off after the check cashes...if you need Lamar to come back out for any reason he'll be there. He cares about building relationships.

Jason came out to our house and gave his honest opinions on multiple diverse plumbing issues. He is very well informed/knowledgeable, skilled, honest, and ethical. With each issue he explained all of our options from most affordable DIY to most expensive. We were thrilled with his repair of our very problematic toilet that several people had recommended we replace. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the toilet itself...the issue was in the pipeline as I had suspected. I am disappointed that other plumbers recommended only an extremely pricey toilet replacement (of course with toilets that they also sell at an upcharge) when the real fix was a five minute auger allowing us to keep a perfectly good (high quality) toilet. Jason and his associate Brian saved us several hundred dollars because they are ethical and honest. Additionally, Jason was the only person able to figure out the source of a mysterious underground leak that had puzzled several plumbers and home inspectors previously. He showed us the source of the problem and explained how to correct it free of charge within five minutes. Last but not least, these gentlemen are true professionals - they are a nice presence within the home; neat, clean, respectful, and pleasant to speak with. Communicating with Jason is super easy; telephone, email, text, online invoices/payment options.This is our 3rd home and we have loads of experience dealing with plumbers and plumbing problems and we can wholeheartedly recommend Jason and his company Building Trust Plumbing!!!",0,0,Q98m6S0Krz7qKDCNmZhYlg,11/8/2016,5,0,41,Home & Service

I will say we had no problems with this company when renting, paying our rent, and living peacefully with no contact as we had no problems with the rental property.  However, this company is very shady.We knew our lease was expiring at the end of April, and had a feeling they would go up on rent as they always do each year.  Luckily we were smart and decided to look for a new place early on in the event the rent did go up.  This is where the shady part comes in.  You have to give Talley a 30 day notice (March 31 for us) your intention of how you would like to continue your lease by either extending another year (at a higher rate) or extending month to month (yet an even higher rate).  Or you have to give Talley a 45 day notice if you intend to vacate (March 16 for us (a weekend date which they are not open)).  They did not send us the letter of their intention on how or if they were going to increase the rate until the week of March 10, so we actually did not receive it in the mail until Wednesday, March 12.  So if you wanted to move out, whether you could afford the new rate or just did not want to pay their new rate (later for us), you had 2 days to make a decision.  Like I said, since it is their thing to increase rent each time, we were ahead of the ball and knew if they increased, we would leave.  If they expect renters to give them proper notice, they should be a good company and give us proper notice to make our decision.We left and now the property is listed for rent at the price we were paying (so they couldn't give us that price as good tenants, instead they would rather let it sit and wait to be rented), they could have had us for another year, plus.  The only positive I can say from this is that we moved out and received our deposit back in a timely manner.  Out of all the rental properties and companies I have dealt with, Talley is my least favorite and I would steer clear from them.",4,0,dG3YJShunnh8i3HzgpwLOA,5/28/2014,1,1,17,Home & Service

I highly suggest for you to not use this company!  Turn around and look at others.We had the same exact issue happen 8 months later.  We called on Memorial Day holiday as our garage would not close, it would just come back up.  The only good thing from this, is we received a call shortly after we left a message and set up an appointment for the next evening.Spencer, did not come out this time and sent out a guy who was not competent to do the work.  He clearly did not know what he was doing, and even called up Spencer while he was there to see what he should check out.They said it was our logic board that needed replacing, and it would cost $350.00.  Well we decided to wait, and paid them the $40 fee to come out and check things out.My husband decided to look up this information, and after reviewing multiple websites, he was not satisfied that the other guy that came out knew what he was doing as he did not check out multiple items that should have been checked out (at least according to these websites).We however, decided to go with their expertise, and bought the logic board ourselves.  $80.00, and they wanted to charge us $350.00?  That means they wanted to make $270.00 for a 15 minute job, which is $1,080.00 per hour.  Dang, I'm in the wrong business!At any rate, our logic board was quickly received, my husband switched it out with no problem in 15 minutes, but it did not help or do anything with the issue.  I called Spencer up on Saturday to schedule him to come back out, not his bad helper, which he agreed to come out on Wednesday evening.After thinking about it, we decided we did not want to go with someone we could not trust.  Someone who could not properly diagnose an issue and then wanted to charge us an absurd amount.  We called someone out who could come out on Sunday with no extra charge, no charge to diagnose or let us know what is going on, and was simply amazing!I cancelled with Spencer and e-mailed him stating he should really not cash my $40 check or at least reimburse me for it if he already had.  The response back was that it is for inspecting and not just diagnosing, they do their best to diagnose.  Well obviously his worker doesn't know how to inspect or diagnose, and the proper business thing would be to waive it this time.  He called me up at my work number and wanted to explain how it was inspecting and travel fee.  Whatever it is, it is absurd and we should have not been charged for the fact that you cost us for sending some guy who is young and inexperienced.  He also mentioned that the $350.00 was just an estimate, he didn't know what garage type I had or how much the logic board would be.  Okay, in that case, say I will return with your quote, rather than it is going to be $350.00 to repair.  I was not going to argue with him while I was at work, so I hung up on him.  But there was never an apology, just an excuse for everything.Luckily, we are not out $350, we are only out $120 ($80 for the part and $40 for their fee to check things out).  There is no trust anymore in Carolina Garage Service to properly do things and do it at a reasonable charge.I will be glad to refer you to someone who will not charge to figure out what is going on, will charge you the proper amount, and has a great business personality to deal with.

The place was incredibly dirty, even though I moved in two days after my lease had started. There were cobwebs everywhere, so much dust that I started coughing, dirt and other particles all over the floor, and of course, the actual structure and appliances were in disrepair. The tubs and sinks were peeling, there were rusted out drawers in the kitchen, soap scum that would not come out of the bathroom fixtures, and lights that were not operational/rusted over. It was shocking, but I wrote to the property manager and they agreed to compensate me. However, it was a negotiation, and the property manager told me there was no way that the place required 8+ hours of cleaning at their professional rate stated in their lease.Turns out, my upstairs neighbors had the same issue and moved into a filthy place. They were compensated double what I received.Then, it was an uphill battle trying to get the owner of the property to fix anything inside. They said it would cost too much money and they needed the place to be empty and to raise rent before they could fix anything. (Funny thing is, I moved to a place in the same neighborhood for the same price that is MUCH newer, cleaner, etc., and it is the same price!) Therefore, I was left with many of the issues I mentioned above, but with no effort on the part of the owner to fix anything.On top of that, their maintenance staff was usually very kind, but there were some times when they (or people they contracted to fix things) would come in and track mud around the apartment and/or damage my belongings. I had to have MPM pay for a new trash can because they broke the lid!In addition, once October rolled around and they started asking about renewing the lease, MPM began their showings. Other landlords in Madison (like my current landlord) try to schedule their showings in fairly short increments (30 mins or so) and on the same day/time period. MPM would block off hour-long periods at inconvenient times (e.g. 5:45pm on a Friday, 10am on a Saturday) and on consecutive days instead of one day (for instance, the company I currently rent with seems to go to certain properties on certain days of the week). It was incredibly difficult to feel like you were living in your own home. There were also incidents where a misunderstanding with the person showing the home led to unpleasant situations; this was mainly due to problems that MPM had with their keys to the place. In response, I would be asked to keep certain doors unsecured so staff could conduct showings, etc. It was incredibly frustrating, since this was an issue that was out of my hands.Finally, after move-out, I was told that the apartment required 7 hours of professional cleaning at the rate of $39.50. This was after I cleaned the apartment extensively over the course of three days; I estimate that I spent about 10 hours at the place Swiffering, vacuuming, getting on my hands and knees to use wood cleaner for the baseboards, floors, doors, shelves, etc., thoroughly cleaning the kitchen and bathroom appliances, and even using the wood solvent/cleaner on the windowsills and inside of the windows. The truth is, the place is incredibly old and dust keeps on accumulating; in fact, pieces of the ceiling/walls seemed to continually break off a little at a time and land on my furniture. I also noticed that dirt was being tracked in during showings, which were consistently happening while I was in the process of cleaning/moving out. However, they were convinced that they would charge me for 7 hours of professional cleaning.When I compared the photographs I took of my initial move-in, I could see a lot of similarities to the kinds of problems they photographed (e.g. a scratch on the wooden floor, yellowing of the tiles on the wall, dirt on the outside of the window -- which isn't the tenant's responsibility since it is on the outside of the building, etc). They were unwilling to admit that I needed 8+ hours of cleaning and did not compensate me fairly at move-in. In fact, my building manager specifically said my documentation did not prove that the apartment required 8+ hours of cleaning. However, the photographic evidence presented at move-out, which they claim amounts to 7 hours of cleaning, is definitely nowhere near as bad as the state of the apartment at move-in. The amount of cleaning supplies used (one big packet of Swiffer wet wipes, almost an entire bottle of wood cleaner, multiple rounds of emptying the vaccum, a whole box of wipes, about 2/3 of a bottle of all-purpose Windex, 2/3 of a pumice stone for the toilet, a substantial amount of bleach and bathroom cleaner, oven cleaner, multiple Magic Erasers, etc.) makes me skeptical about their claims.I hope to contest this with MPM and find a resolution that is amenable to both parties. We'll see what happens. Next step: contacting Wisconsin DATCP.",27,4,zaPe8GFcJyYXhGX_jmoHlg,8/30/2014,1,4,-11,Home & Service

After 10 minutes of no cab I decided to give them a call and make sure they were on the way.  The woman who answered the phone informed me that they had canceled the cab service because they didn't have a zip code for my address? No, I had not given them a zip code (which I should add they didn't ask for), but they did have my phone # so they were quite capable of calling and asking for the zip code. And did I receive a phone call...ummm, not so much!  I asked for another cab and she told me it would take at least 20 minutes....I did the math and realized the 20 minutes would cost me another day in Phoenix, which probably wouldn't have been so bad if I had known the cold Chicago weather that was awaiting me.  I did end up making my flight, but with no thanks to Discount Cab.  Gabi K was a real trooper and jumped out of bed to take me.  Thanks Gabi!

This location (32nd St) is the 2nd location I have visited and actually, is the closer to my house.  Dr De Santo works between both offices, with Tue and Thur being at this one, I believe.  It's much the same here and has the same set-up and benefits as the other (ultrasound machines, lab in office, etc).

It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  * There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.See ya there!",3,2,soJZKewVj1wHvsB87LultQ,3/4/2011,5,1,33,Health & Medical

I'd love to get down to prepregnancy weight but it seems harder to take off now that I don't have youth or free time on my side.  That's where the MedShape crew are are going to help.Today's visit was awesome.  The staff, Brittany specifically, was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Most of them are success stories, too, so they really identify with your health/weight loss goals.  They set me up with easy-to-understand nutritional guidelines and explained how everything works.  I'm super excited.  This is a medically supervised weight loss clinic so I feel more at ease.  I've never tried the herbal or over the counter stuff because... I don't trust them.  With MedShape, though, I selected an 8 week program with tons of clinic staff support... because I'm sure I'll need nudges and hellos from supportive people.

I had spoken to a friend on the phone on my way to the ER and was told that SHS is a very good hospital with quality doctors (friend recruits doctors), but after speaking with sis and her husband, who advised me to go to an Urgent Care instead, I decided to leave this ER, especially when I heard it was a teaching hospital.  I told the admissions officer I was leaving, and as I walked away, I texted my doctor-recruiting friend that I was heading to a UC facility.  He called me immediately and advised me to go back to the ER as a.) I was already there; and b.) even if it's a teaching facility, this ER will have quality doctors shadowing interns; and c.) ERs are better-equipped at repairing head lacerations than UCs.  So I returned to the lobby and to my seat, dismayed at the number of other patients that had arrived, but it was probably five minutes later that the triage nurse called out my name so that she may take me in and input my vitals.  This nurse never greeted me hello, how are you, and never replied back when I said thank you (at least three times).  She was very curt and efficient, as I imagine triage nurses would have to be since ERs could get very hectic, but a little warmth would've been nice.Nurse Laura was much-friendlier and smiling the whole time, and also was nice to talk to.  I met Cory, who I first thought was another nurse, but now think perhaps he is a resident intern.  Laura took more vitals before and after, and explained what were going to happen (cleaning of the wound by Cory, numbing injection and stapling by ER doctor, and paperwork involved so that I may leave after) while I was there, and also instructions for cleaning and maintenance of the staples before getting them removed ten days later.  After Corey washed the site with hydrogen peroxide, the ER doc Norquist came in, introduced himself with a handshake (that's nice), introduced another woman who was there to record my answers to his questions (what happened, when, and how), and then proceeded to explain what he was going to do.  He advised that the two shots of numbing solution will hurt (syringe puncture and burning sensation of painkiller), but all I felt was a cool sensation spreading over the painful area.  Funny that my blood pressure was normal when I came in (90 systolic), but was at 115 systolic after the procedure-- I think Dr. Norquist's warnings made me very nervous, as well as the sound and feel of five staples being applied on my scalp!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scottsdale-healthcare-shea-scottsdale-5#6oYPYy5h-TsdDF6ce1_Z0gMy experience at this ER was fast and overall pleasant, with the exception of the stoic triage nurse.  I wished it didn't take so long for me to be able to leave (exit papers and payment), but perhaps it was time well-spent to decompress from everything that had happened that morning; a good time for my blood pressure to fall back to normal before driving home.  I hope I, or other beloveds, will not have any reason to go to an ER, but if we do, it's nice to know I may depend on Scottsdale Healthcare Shea and its staff for efficiency and overall friendly care while here.",27,22,sppgg_4QXgy218qj7NJj-Q,4/11/2015,3,15,32,Health & Medical

No mud bed.  No sliced garnishes placed on the windows of my soul.  However, I did get two women to simultaneously massage my back (Cassie) and leg muscles (Patty)!!  Woah!  So this is what tandem massages are all about!!  I asked if this was standard practice here in SWINA, 'cause if it is, I could definitely get used to this!  But no, I'm told that I got lucky that day, w/ students' schedules opening up at just the right moment to allow me this extra luxury.  (If you ask me, I think it's a ploy to get newbies to come back for treatments week after week!)But let's backtrack a bit and start in the beginning.  After stripping down to my comfort level (topless), and lying face down on the massage table (I requested a face pillow for more comfort), Cassie and Patty proceeded to give me the back and leg massages.  Afterwards, they employed natural brushes over exposed areas for an all-over exfoliation.  The sensations ranged from slightly ticklish to soothing (you may tailor the pressure exerted).  I was asked to flip over onto my back, and soon after, the mud was then painted on by both women with another set of brushes.  This was when the treatment started to go downhill for me... the mud was applied cold, and thank goodness there was a heat lamp nearby to keep me warm.  After painting my back, arms, legs, and abs, the two women proceeded to wrap plastic around my extremities and then again w/ another wrap that was already laid on top of the massage table under me.  (If you suffer from claustrophobia, body wraps are not for you!)  Patty then left Cassie to help another student.  Cassie then proceeded to give me my second favorite part of the treatment, which is a head and neck massage.  Nice!!  After, Cassie offered to give me something complimentary- a facial massage!  Would I want one?  Why, yes, thank you very much!  After all that pampering, we were now at the point where I again had to endure chills while Cassie wiped off the mud w/ warm towels.  But I requested hotter towels, as in steaming hot!, and poor Cassie... her hands were burning!, but she did what I requested, and I was able to stave off the chills for awhile.  To ""wrap"" things up, Cassie followed up w/ a hypoallergenic Lotus Touch lotion.  My skin felt supple, but nothing different than what I'd experience after a bath at home using Aveda Soothing Therapy salts.  On the whole, the experience was good, but most of it is bec. of Cassie's bedside manner.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask for her again.  However, I don't think I'd try another wrap- SWINA offers three: mud, seaweed, and herbal- since I'd rather not get chilled, plus the plastic wraps used aren't biodegradeable, so I'd feel guilty causing all that pollution!  I'd say that the tandem, head, neck, and facial massages were my favorite parts, and for that, I'll just stick w/ SWIHA.  I will be back to try other services (hour-long facials for $30, anyone?).",8,5,wJdRSZc0vZeE8D_V-5Zdyg,1/19/2009,3,4,25,Health & Medical

I've been a patient of Dr. Madonna Mallari, one of the internists here, since 2013.  I've also seen two other internists when she wasn't available, and Drs. Atienza and Wong were just as warm, friendly, efficient, and accessible as she is.  The reception staff are also nice and upbeat.  My first visit with Dr. Mallari was for a wellness/physical, a yearly check-up I always find stressful for it includes a Pap test, and I knew that Mallari was going to be my new doctor when the Pap test ended just a few seconds after it began and, more importantly, was PAINLESS!  This annual procedure always seemed to last for longer than ten minutes and necessitated the use of super-cold metal instruments that caused much anxiety and pain, but with Mallari, I barely felt a pinch!  I actually said ""That's it?""  I went home and told Mom I found a doctor for us, so she promptly made an appointment to see her, too.After that initial appointment, I found it hard to schedule the next few visits with Mallari (either she was on vacation, or working at another location) and I've had to settle for Urgent Care when I came down with colds and sinus infections and an appointment with Dr. Atienza, who did my second physical and proposed booster shots (flu and tetanus-- don't believe when you're told you will be sore for only a few days... I was sore for almost three weeks!).  Atienza also informed me that if my past Pap tests have been normal, then I won't have to take it every year- whew!  Dr. Wong was the doctor that removed the staples on my head that I acquired after a fainting spell that left me with a 1.5 inch parietal gash, which an emergency doctor at the Shea Hospital next door stapled shut ten days before.  Wong was affable and easy-going, as if we've known each other for a long time.  When I tried to schedule an appointment to see Mallari, but couldn't get an earlier date and time, I tried to ask for Wong, or even Atienza, but was told that if Mallari was scheduled to work at the Shea clinic, then I will have to wait for an appointment with her.  For that, I'd only rate 3.5 stars out of five.  The other star is for the in-house lab for blood work and other lab tests, which I always have to get done, thanks to my fainting spells, viitamin D deficiency, and other traits I have been blessed with.  No more trekking to other labs, often far from home, with orders in hand.  Just show up a little earlier before your doctor's appointment, or hang out after and get them done here.  The phlebotomists are efficient and skilled at what they do, and if one isn't sure he, or she will be able to get it right the first time (my veins can get very shy, especially when it's chilly outdoors, or indoors, and it almost always is chilly inside clinics), then the initial phlebotomist will ask the other one to step in, which is what happened this morning.  Kudos to the woman who studied both of my arms for the better vein, instead of puncturing me at both arms and feet, without success, like those phlebotomy students did at the Mayo Clinic a few years ago!  I hope that I'm able to find a home nearby to move into, so I won't have to search for another medical group!",55,53,A4IPBr9pb5FHTT0too2jRQ,2/4/2016,5,35,14,Health & Medical

I bought two certificates thinking I'd gift them to my Mom.  She ended up not wanting to use them, so I decided to try the treatments myself.  VelaShape laser treatments are supposed to be most effective when one goes for the full five-treatment process, but I thought I'd try two treatments and see how they go.I didn't care for the representatives at the desk that checked me in, esp. the blonde, straight-haired woman who wouldn't make eye contact (on ALL my visits)-- I also had the misfortune of hearing her complain on her cellphone w/ a merchant about a charge made on her credit card that first visit, while I was waiting for someone to greet me at the desk.  Michael, who did the treatments on me, was very personable.  When he saw the area I wanted work done, he asked what I wanted to do, and I said to get rid of the flab in my ab area.  He said something to the effect that I didn't have much to get rid of, and then proceeded w/ the treatment.  The two-part process included a tool that applied a lot of heat in short bursts that would end w/ one that was almost too painful to endure, and then he'd move to another area- most of the bursts would feel like hot pinches.  I ended up doing a total of three treatments (paying another $99 for the third), had burn marks from the last two, and still did not see any improvements.Michael mentioned how I won't see much reduction since I'm smaller than the average patient he sees at the clinic- that larger patients see results faster (??), and that full benefits won't be seen until after four of five treatments.  My reply to those statements were that since I didn't have much to get rid of, shouldn't it take less than five treatments then to see any results?  So please learn from my vain attempts to keep aging and laziness from taking over my body and stay away from expensive VelaShape laser treatments that do not work.  (These treatments were offered at 75% off.)  I could've stayed mum and not have you know about my foolishness (""a fool and his money are soon parted"" definitely applies here, doesn't it?), but I'd rather admit to it and cry in shame in hopes to help a few of you decide against trying this treatment!  Use your money instead and enroll in a gym, or buy a few exercise DVDs and exercise in the comfort of your own living room![I've gone back to running on the treadmill again, after my broken toe healed, so I'm losing the flab slowly, but surely.  :)]",23,13,fORGcQMYB94qOHEkIOBZPw,6/5/2011,1,15,13,Health & Medical

Of course, it's just a grocery store and the magic of yesteryear has somewhat abandoned me, but they still put together a fine assortment of goods. The produce section, for example, is above average.

Luxury accommodations aren't quite to the standard of the Wynn or Cosmo per se, but they've got more than enough to satisfy the average spa goer.There is rock climbing, a full scale gym with treadmills, weights, and the works.

I guess that's what I get for Waking Up In Vegas...As you can imagine, my debauchery from the previous night left me severely hungover so after getting a bite to eat at Grand Lux Cafxc3xa9, my friend suggested that we all go to Canyon Ranch Spa Club for some ""Steam Therapy"".  On Saturday, 2.19.11, we (party of six) came to CRSC at around 1 PM. There are two employees at the front desk. It took about 10 minutes to check-in and pay. There's a women, men and co-ed section in the spa. We stayed at the women's only section. FEE$40/day pass to use the gym and spa facilities. HOWEVER, it's only $20/person if your hotel room (Palazzo or The Venetian) is charged with a resort fee. If it's not, I highly recommend you paying the $17.95 one-time resort fee at the spa because it will cover everyone in your party. My friend paid the resort fee, so we ended up saving about $17/person. LOCKER ROOMYou will be provided a magnet key wristlet to access your locker. Your robe will be provided in your locker. TIP: BRING YOUR OWN SLIPPERS/FLIP FLOPS! TRUST ME!The pressure point slippers that's provided are the most UNCOMFOTABLE slippers ever! With each step, it felt like I was walking on pebble stone pavement. EVERYONE was complaining about how painful they were and that we were better off wearing out 5-inch stilettos from the previous night...no joke! I hated those slippers so much, I wanted to BURN mine after leaving!AQUAVANA THERMAL ENVIRONMENTSVarious aquathermal environments that are designed to help with muscle relaxation, increase oxygen flow and most importantly RID YOUR BODY OF TOXINS! The perfect ""morning after"" remedy after a night of copious drinking!ROOM #1: IGLOOExactly as the name says, it's basically a big freezer. My least favorite of all the rooms because of the cold temperature. ROOM #2: JACUZZ WITH HEATED LOUNGERSThe jacuzzi (bathing suit optional) could accommodate about 8-10 people. I LOVED the heated loungers (there were 6). They were made of some type of Styrofoam material that was firm yet soft. The loungers were so warm and comforting that I could have slept on it the whole day.ROOM #3: HERBAL  LACONIUM (WET STEAM ROOM) - HANGOVER CURE!!!!!If you're not use to humid heat, the Herbal Laconium room may be too much to handle in the beginning. HOWEVER, after several minutes, your body will adjust to the heat and it will become very bearable.  As I closed my eyes, breathed in deeply and exhaled, I could feel my body releasing all the tequila and goose through my pores and my pounding headache becoming fainter and fainter.  TIP: Drink plenty of water beforehand and pick up an iced towel (to cover your face) in the Jacuzzi room which will make it much easier to breathe in the steam room.  ROOM #4: Finnish Sauna (Dry Heat Room)Not a fan of dry heat rooms as I feel like I'm stuck in a charcoal bbq minus the charcoal. ROOM #5: Crystal Steam Room (Aromatherapy Steam Room)Saving the best for last! The aromatherapy steam room is less intense than the Herbal Laconium room and the fragrant floral scents will enhance your mood. THE QUIET ROOM/LOUNGEEnd your Aquavana Session at the quiet room where you can lay on plushy oversized sofas while reading trashy magazines and munching on fresh apples, bananas and oranges. It was so quiet and serene that I ended up taking a 10-minute power nap. I woke up refreshed with my pounding headache all gone!SHOWER/MAKEUP ROOM*10-15 private showers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash in each one*Personal sink area with lotions, deodorant, hair care products, hair dryer, combs, brushes, etc*If you need a curling iron or flat iron, you can get it at the front deskTIP: If you need a razer, shower cap, and/or towels, make sure to grab them before getting into the shower room. They're located near the entrance way to the showers.OVERALL LAYOUTThe CRSC is BIG and I didn't even know how big until I got lost and ended up on the men's side. It's confusing to say the least and it was like a maze to get out. If you suffer from ""Waking Up In Vegas"" syndrome like I always seem to, I highly recommend coming to the CRSC to get you out of your funk!",12,3,dPXJNnBIYeIETYy01Euvbg,2/28/2011,3,7,23,Health & Medical

Several friends raved about the experience with such remarks as ""opening up the Google search of your brain"" to ""feeling like the 1 hour mark after 'shroom tea"" to ""mentally going to Mars"".  Their levels of sobriety ranged from stone cold to having smoked an ounce in the parking lot.  I was somewhere in between.      The friendly attendant, John, clearly explained what to do and how to operate the pod.  Being a first timer, I also watched a 6 minute video on how to maximize my float time which offered some helpful suggestions (body position, breathing) while glazing over some new age, self improvement stuff.  John also informed me to hang in their relaxation room upon finishing since many feel disoriented and extremely euphoric afterwards.  Uhhh..what??  So I get out of the shower, put the ear plugs in, get in the pod.....""And I'm floating in a most peculiar way""I initially found the whole thing a bit comical.  Here I am...naked, in a dark and confined space, lying in 93.5 degree water...isn't this a torture method in Guantanamo Bay?  But after I got over the initial weirdness, things got interesting....   ""And the stars look very different today""It definitely felt like drifting in outer space.  My mind darted through a billion thoughts before I was able to end up in a kind of neutral, semi-conscious, relaxed zone.  I could not believe I was in the pod for only an hour as it felt much longer than that.They claim health benefits like the improvement of memory/sports performance/sleep quality, alleviating PMS, helping with creativity, softer skin etc.  Let me tell you....my PMS was fuckin loooong gooooone!!!  :P  I don't know about this experience helping with all that, but I definitely left in a prolonged state of relaxation.

After being sick of contacts and glasses for 15+ years, she finally wanted to get it done.After some research and speaking with a few facilities, it seemed like the best choice was either here or Lasik of Nevada.  We chose Siems based on our talk with the consultant, price for the exact same treatment and also their proximity to our home.  My wife didn't want to schlep it all the way to Henderson for follow ups.  Dr. Siems made us feel comfortable right away upon the first meeting.  His office is very nice.  The lobby feels spa-like.  Needless to say we were nervous when the big day finally came for her to get the procedure done.  You hear that there's a high 90% success rate but a person only has one pair of eyes.  Dr. Siems and his staff made my wife as comfortable as possible (valium helped).  I was able to view the whole procedure on a television outside of the operating room and it definitely made me wince a little when they cut the lens and started shooting the lasers in her eyes. The whole procedure took less than 30 minutes.  She then took another valium and slept for about 18 hours.  She was able to see very clearly the next day and it just improved from there.  Post operation checkups are included in the price so the day after, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year were all taken care of.  Now that it has been well over a year, she says it's one of the best things she's ever done in life.  I've worn glasses more than half of my life and feel like the fat guy at Mr Olympia or the dude with no tattoos in a tattoo parlor when I go in there.  They always ask me when I am going to do it.  I am still on the fence about getting it done myself but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate to go with Siems.",28,12,PeYoFeu4UYMxX9pFqZAt2w,3/5/2013,5,9,17,Health & Medical

Thank you Yelp for sending me their way!Belly Bliss is a combination of things - a boutique store for mamas-to-be (and future dads), a spa, and offers classes and groups that are related to pregnancy and babies.Recently, I went specifically to experience their spa services.  Taking advantage of their seasonal specials, I got the Joyful Package for $170.  It consisted of a 60 minute ""Girls Getaway"" massage and a 90 minute signature ""Body in Balance"" facial treatment.  Joann M. was my massage therapist and Margo S. was my aesthetician.  Because this place specializes in working with pregnant woman, they make every attempt to make sure that you are comfortable during all your treatments.  Tables easily adjust for the head and body and plenty of pillows and supports are available for your comfort.  Both were professional and friendly and you get the feeling they both really enjoy working with all their pregnant clients. (Margo told me to come back again and bring the baby!)  Sure, there are plenty of spas in town that offer prenatal massage, but you end up paying an upcharge to use their facilities.  When in actuality, most pregnant women are discouraged from using the jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc.  So you end up feeling a bit short changed when all you wanted was some personal body work done.  Belly Bliss gives you just that without all the frills.  They only have a few treatments rooms available, so it shouldn't be crowded when you go.Once your treatment is done, you can help yourself to their little snack bar where you can fill a take out box full of pretzels, goldfish crackers, lollipops, and raisins.  Plenty of spa water and apples are available too.Getting treatments done on Tuesdays also gives you 10% off your spa services!  Sweet!  Apparently, free eyebrow waxes and foot massages are available on Tuesdays as well.  Call ahead to confirm and make reservations! You can't help but take a look through their store on your way out.  So many cool and useful items are available for you to check out and purchase.  It can be a bit dangerous actually!Belly Bliss is located on the 2nd floor of the Desert Perinatal Associates office, so doctors are only a few steps away if you're really concerned about anything.Classes include Breastfeeding, Yoga (Pre and Postnatal), Newborn Care and Immunization, Baby Massage, How to Select a Childcare Facility, and Childbirth Education.  Medela breast pumps are available for rental too! They also have party rental space if you want to plan a baby shower or private party at their facility.Gift certificates are available and any pregnant girl would be happy to receive a service from Belly Bliss!  Husbands, boyfriends, fathers, partners, friends - check this place out and give a great gift for a future mama!

(What's even sweeter, you can buy 5 gift cards and get 1 free here!! Score!)Bali Foot Spa is yet another place that has popped up in Vegas and smack dab in the oh so popular area of Spring Mountain.  This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.Walking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)Walking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)

I inquired if they had 2 females available in five minutes and they said yes. After explaining our options between the Basic ($20/hr) or Deep Tissue ($30/hr), and Yelp 'specials', we settled on the Basic. (Basic is more footwork whereas Deep Tissue is more back work.)We were led into the main room that has about 7 massage beds. I went to the restroom first and noticed they were out of soap. I took the time to open the dispenser in hopes that they 'just' ran out. Nope. Nothing in there. I even checked under the sink and found 3 more empty soap bottles! I was desperate and added some water and shook it just to get something soapy to wash my hands with. I reported back to the Husband with my discovery and was surprised he didn't suggest leaving. Buckets of hot water arrived for our feet to soak and I've noticed only 1 female employee is available. (This is exactly why I call ahead.) They offer us tea or water while we soaked. They left us soaking for about 10 minutes. (I hope they don't count this as part of our hour and luckily, they didn't! It's happened to us before!) Another female arrives and they both get to work. I had LINDA and the Husband had BELLA. Linda was great! I made the mistake of declining a private single room when she offered it and now I know why. It was a pretty cramped area for her to work around as I was seated against the wall. She had to make the long trek around the other chairs to move from my head to my feet since there was  a table blocking her pathway. So that was my mistake. She did some pretty great scalp work, which I definitely appreciate it. She also does some stretching. But my favorite was her back work. She does more of a back rolling pressure massage which is what I needed, but then she kneeled on my back and put all her weight in. Mind blown! It was pretty freakin' awesome. When the Husband's massage girl tried talking to mine, she shushed her. Gotta love that! (The Husband says I usually get the chatty ones, which I detest.) When my massage was done, I told the Husband that I was leaving a bigger tip. He agreed that he would be too! He was similarly impressed with Bella's back work as well. For the Basic service, I was quite pleased. It's pretty rare when we both are equally impressed with our massage people.At the beginning of my session, the front desk guy comes by to let me know that if I need anything, to let Linda know. I take this opportunity to tell him there's no more soap in the restroom.  He didn't understand and so I repeated myself. He seemed to understand and said he would take care of it right away. So, of course at the end of my session, I just had to check to see if they got soap. Nope! C'mon! I gave the guy over an hour to buy some soap and it didn't happen! When we went to pay, I told him again there was no soap in the restroom. Again, he didn't understand and I repeated myself. Then it seemed like he understood and relayed something to Linda. Ultimately, no business should ever run out of soap! They do accept credit cards, but there's a 50 cent charge. It's posted, but it would have been nice to be told this since the Husband only realized it when he signed the credit card slip. The guy did give us back our 50 cents though. 5 stars for Linda and Bella but 2 stars for the facilities and no soap!

But since the Baby was born, it was time to go back to getting some serious work done and Best Foot Spa was calling!First off, I chose this place because it was blowing up on Yelp at the time and second of all, the famous Rex opened this place up.  So, I had to go where he was and experience his magical hand, right?It was my mom and I on this experience and we made appointments just in case.  We were led into a semi-private space with two chairs.  Rex worked on me while my mom had Lee.  As with all of good foot massage places, your feet start off in a hot bath while they work on you head, neck and shoulders.  Then they eventually move onto your feet and then have you sit up to work on your shoulders before having you flip over and lie down!  Yep, lie down I tell you!  I love it when they tell me to flip over and lie down!  (Not all Vegas foot massage places offer this ""flip over"" business!)  That's when they get to working on your back and pushing you this way and that way while your face is in this hole.  This is what I was looking for!One of the cool things they have are hooks for your purse and jackets - nice touch.  It's the little things that matter!I definitely appreciated that Rex makes a point of looking at the clock when he starts and telling you what time it is so there's no confusion about that.  (Unlike a few other places that claim you're getting a 60 minute treatment, but it's really 50.)At the end of our service, Rex assures me that it's always the same people working there - himself, Lee, Elaine (or Eileen) and Carol.  I think this is because there are so many places that contract workers here and there.  So that makes me feel that you are certain of getting a specific kind of experience there.They also offer a Yelp discount too! 4.5 stars.* Update! (09.20.11)Going down to a 4 star rating.  Lee worked on me last night and although he was good, the smell of cigarette smoke is very distracting.  I hate to have to ask ahead of time if the person working on me is a smoker or not, but I have a strong sense of smell!  That put me off from the very beginning.  Also, Rex took a call while he was working on the Husband.  Yes, I know it's business and all, but very distracting and a big pet peeve of ours.  Get someone else to handle the phones please. Right before they started working on our feet, they mentioned that they could make my feet like a baby's butt...for an additional 30 minutes and a $29 charge.  It includes a hot wax...which I assume is a parafin wax dip. Although I love having my feet super soft, we had to pass this time around.",12,7,sKosVzKNcwUBqJc4RMyElA,6/30/2011,4,3,31,Health & Medical

We always welcome a little healthy competition, even if Vegas does seem a bit over saturated with foot massage places.  We aren't always so anxious to make the drive to Spring Mountain to get some foot work done.The Husband noticed the sign driving on S. Rainbow and with only two yelp reviews, we were a bit hesitant.  We called ahead to find out the prices and to see if there was any availability.  They normally charge $38/hr, but with the Yelp discount - it's $34.  (They are currently offering a Yelp Deal too - $15 for $20 towards service, which I doubt you can combine.)We didn't make an appointment but were the only ones there last night.  Angel warmly greeted us and had us take a seat amongst the handful of chairs in the main room.  As she went to get us our tea, she hastily made a few calls getting her employees in as they had gone on an errand.  She told us about her business, gave us some information on Pure Foot & Spa and reflexology, and asked us what we thought of the interior decorating.  She had our feet soaking in the hot water while we waited, so we didn't mind.  It wasn't too long when one of the ladies returned.  She immediately got started on the Husband, so Angel started working on me while I waited for my guy to return.  As her delicate hands started working on my face, I was almost hoping my guy didn't return.  (There are some people that have gentle hands, and she's one of them.)  After a few minutes, my guy did arrive and he got started on me.Everything was pretty straightforward from them on - they work on your head, neck, and shoulders before heading to your feet and calves.  And after wiping down your feet, they flip you over so you get some back work.  One thing I really appreciate here is that they actually spend a good amount of time on your feet and calves.  Sometimes other places focus more on shoulders, but my feet and calves were what needed the attention and they got it.  Usually, I can tell the Husband is having a good experience when I hear him snoring.  This time, I didn't hear him snore at all, so I was concerned.  I was pleasantly surprised when he asked the name of his lady though because he obviously wanted to remember who she was.  Overall, we were both quite happy with our experience at Pure Foot and definitely glad to have them in the neighborhood.  We'll definitely be going back again!He had EVA and I had IVAN.* They charge $1 to use your credit card.  I recommend calling to make an appointment to be sure.

(Of course, this is not to be confused with the service also known as body shampoos found at places with questionable intentions.)When inquiring about this service, we were led passed the chairs reserved for foot massages and into the back room.  This room had three massage beds with sinks specifically built attached to them.  The Husband and I then had our shoulders covered with a towel and plastic to prevent those areas from getting wet and we laid down with our heads over the sink.  This is where the similarities ended.The person I had was Mark.  I have long hair.  He started to massage my scalp for a little while before turning the water on to wet my hair.  He then shampooed my hair and spent a considerable amount of time 'scratching' my scalp.  This is something that can be enjoyable and quite relaxing depending on the person and the circumstance, but it was just okay this time.  He then also did some cranial pressure before rinsing my hair of the shampoo and applying conditioner.  He made a point of making sure my hair was completely conditioned as he ran a comb through it all.  And then he rinsed all the conditioner out and squeezed some of the water out of my hair.  I was then instructed to get up so we could walk to a smaller room where he would blow dry my hair.  He then dried my hair and ran a brush through it to get rid of any tangles.  And then I was done.  Unfortunately, my hair was still a bit damp and the bottom half of my shirt in the back was all wet from the walk from the sink to the blow drying room.  (Perhaps he could have wrapped my hair in a towel to prevent that from happening.)  He apologized for the wet shirt part but I had to go blow dry my shirt as a result.  3 stars.Meanwhile, the Husband has practically no hair and he had Reao.  He said he didn't get that much scratching, but more pressure on his scalp, face, and shoulders.  While I was getting my hair blow dried, he was still getting cranial work done.  He felt so relaxed that he almost fell asleep.  He tried to inquire about what other services would take place if we had chosen the 60 minute option, but Reao did not quite understand him.  She thought he was trying to extend his experience to the 60 minute one.  He wanted to know if they were going to focus more on the scalp, shoulders, or face.  He really enjoyed it and would do it again.  4.5 stars from him.I think I lost out on the experience because: a) I had a guy.  (And unfortunately I believe he smelled of cigarette smoke.  So with my sensitive sense of smell, and him running his hands through my hair, it was distracting.)  b) I have long hair.  Because so much time was spent shampooing, conditioning, and blow drying, there was less time for cranial work. Yes, I know it's called a head shampoo but you know you're really there for good cranial work.  It's almost like a glorified hair shampooing experience at your local salon.  Overall, I think if you're a bald guy, you may just love it.  Half the experience at a hair salon is getting your head shampooed and massaged and this place focuses on that part.  Unfortunately, I just didn't get that many head tingles from the experience like I was hoping for!  Would I go back?  Maybe - if I cut my hair and/or if I get a girl next time.  Some girls just know how to massage the scalp better, maybe it's the nail thing? 30 minutes = $2560 minutes = $4860 minutes combo = $45 (30 minute head shampoo and 30 minute reflexology)They are located exactly next door to Ichiza.

I feared that my son would ask me to dress like Herman Munster or a Walking Dead character, neither which would be far-fetched if you knew me.

I, as customary, kept my thoughts to myself, but was tempted to ask the quiet woman if she really wanted to marry such a loud,  rude woman. I couldn't restrain myself, though, from asking the staff if they offered walk-up annulment / divorce services, but not within earshot of the couple.

Mercy has never been strong here - they excel in friendliness, not in convenience.  For the emergency room, you get a nice - almost cozy - parking lot.  For the main entrance, parking is decent, but not particularly close.  Luckily, I scored a ride from some guy in a golf cart.  I am lucky that he did not seem to be a fan of Movie Macabre.  At least, if he is, he was working, and did not have time to 'cart' me to the woods.

Sure, they are all over the place, but do you pull into the first one you find?  Unlike fast food, where you will probably be okay if you get a sub-par burger, you may want to do your best to make sure you get a good one when it comes to your teeth.Unfortunately there is no really good system.  Most of us look for a decent office, find a solid web page, depend on suggestions from our insurance carrier or ask our friends for ideas.  We might even ask people on the web!  And then we pull into the most convenient place anyway because we have put it off for so long we really have little other choice - and then generally pull out unhappy.  Heh.

The receptionist is very sweet, even offering to check into our insurance before we even arrive (of course, that helps them as much as it does us), and the waiting room is incredibly welcoming, and especially so for a dentist.Office hours are great - they are closed on Mondays, but they make up for it by being open later on other days and even on Saturdays!  The actual work rooms are almost as nice as the waiting room, and you even score a television of your very own, but because this is a small practice, you really get very little time to check anything out on the tube since they work so quickly.  I was unable to even locate the Spice Channel.I only hesitate to give a fifth star for two reasons.  One is that I have no skill as a dentist myself, so I am unable to tell if Dr. Park is really that talented or just good at making you feel like he knows what he is doing.  Now I could go all Steve Martin a la Little Shop of Horrors, but that really would not help me rate Dr. Park, which is the important part in judging (even though it may be fun as a second career).

Christopher was my massage therapist and was very friendly.

No membership (like some massage places in Charlotte)...and no additional cost (unless you want a different type of massage or to add aromatherapy).   What a bargain!  And the massage itself was everything I had hoped it would be.  VERY relaxing, quiet music, comfortable setting.  I felt no difference between the massage at Zen and the more expensive massages I've had.  I highly recommend this as a special treat for both men and women.  And not just for  birthdays!  You can't go wrong at the great prices offered!  Each room in this old house in historic Dilworth is a different massage room...and you can even do couples massages in a bigger room if you want.

I went to this dentist for years when I lived in Charlotte, from 1996 to 2009.  They seemed to be okay, though I had a few issues here and there. Once one dentist left me so long that the numbing for a small cavity filling wore off before he got back. Had to re-inject me and wait again while that one took effect. Another dentist (no longer works here) and the dental hygienist talked in a foreign language for a few seconds while they were working on me...and you know what that means as far as what (who) they were talking about...very uncomfortable... I've been blessed with pretty good teeth -- have only had two cavities that I remember, and those were tiny...one didn't even require numbing, and the other was borderline so I opted for it (the aforementioned absentee dentist).  I also had a couple of ""clean and seals"" where they grind out a soft spot in your enamel and then seal it to prevent it from becoming a cavity. I've since moved to another city and had to get another dentist here locally. On my first visit it was quickly determined that my new dentist would have to re-do everything that this dentist's office had done.  One of my (tiny -- hello?! this shouldn't have been hard!) cavity fillings had since fallen out, unbeknownst to me, and the seals were both poorly done and were leaking.  One of the seals was so bad that decay had formed under it and was starting to get bad -- nothing the new dentist couldn't clean out and fix up, but -- SHEESH!  My new dentist blasted out both seals, cleaned the decay under the one tooth, and redid the seals properly.  He also replaced the now-missing filling on the tiny cavity.Needless to say, I just dropped $300 (my out-of-pocket after insurance) to have this dentist office's work redone.

I've been going to these doctors since '04 and these shifts in culture only started within the last couple of years.We've had cancellations of appointments (that were made months in advanced) for no reason and at the last moment.  I've had their coordinator schedule back-to-back appointments between specialists and my doctor only to have them attempt to refuse seeing me because of my tardiness (which was expected and had been noted in the appointments by the coordinator herself).

In essence, I would have to schedule a doctor visit every 30 days to continue receiving a medicine that they had already been prescribing me for YEARS.  This blatant attempt at boosting their revenue sickens me.  It doesn't improve your quality of care and penalizes those with limited or non-existent medical insurance.

It's strange to be treated like you're at a 4-star hotel when visiting the Clinic, at least, that was my impression.  My father-in-law is in town from Puerto Rico.  He needed a procedure done pretty quick one day.  So I called the clinic's scheduling phone number and was able to get an appointment in an hour!  This isn't to say that everyone would get an appointment in an hour, so I guess we were lucky.  I was on the phone with an Alan, who told me where to go and what to do once we get there to ensure we get to the appointment on time.  He recommended valet parking at the Intercontinental Hotel, which we did.  That saved us at least 15 minutes.  Once we were in the clinic, we were able to find the doctor's office pretty quickly.  Since my father-in-law is considered an international patient, he had to register as an international patient, which took only 10 minutes.  Then, a worker from the international patients registration desk took us to talk to the finance guy, who basically took the credit card information.Finally, we were escorted to the office where the appointment was.  First, on floor 7, they took my father-in-law's vital signs and cleared him for the next step of the process.  We then went to the 8th floor where he was screened with questions.  Once we passed that test, we went to the 9th floor where the actual procedure was performed by the doctor.  Unfortunately, the doctor recommended surgery as a result of the procedure.So about a week and many follow-up visits later, my father-in-law had surgery and recovered at our home.  We were also assigned a very nice interpreter, not that we needed one.  Instead of interpreting, she was really there to comfort us and answer any questions we had during the process.  She would simply show up each time we had an appointment and she visited after the surgery too.This whole process left me in awe, not only of the physical monstrosity that is the Cleveland Clinic, but also of the superior level of service that they strive for to provide every moment of every day.I'm going here from now on for my appointments.Totally recommend!",16,5,z4ssQwmYQ730VItrUFZO0w,5/8/2011,5,2,23,Health & Medical

I'd been interested in a photofacial for years, so when the procedure only took about 15 minutes--application of gel, 2 passes of the laser (once to treat red areas, once to treat brown spots), and application of moisturizer with SPF--I was disappointed.  Turns out I didn't really need a photofacial after all.  My results were basically non-existent; perhaps those with more significantly damaged skin would benefit from this procedure.  Most of all and as stated previously, I was disappointed in how short the treatment lasted.  It would have been nice to work in a facial massage, masque, or something similar to increase the bang-for-buck.  Had I paid full price I'd have felt taken advantage of.My microdermabrasion in February, on the other hand, was really nice--a great boost for my winter blah skin.  I thought the process was gentle, and I experienced no discomfort or redness or irritation at all.

In a word, run.  In two words, run quickly.This is a long story but trust that it is worth reading. I saw the same dentist from the time I was 4 till I was to 22. Same dentist my family saw, highly trusted, wonderful man. At 22 I moved from Murrysville to Pittsburgh to finish graduate school. Picked Dr Relis because he was closeby- naively, I figured any dentist is as good as the next (mistake #1). Got a cleaning, learned I had a between tooth cavity. Returned for filling (mistake number 2). Drilling for filling took ages. I began to worry.I expect my teeth to be a little sensitive after a filling but I felt like someone was trying to pull my teeth out of my head after he was done. Worse, days later my teeth still hurt like mad. At this point I realized...I'd perhaps made a mistake in selecting this dentist. So I went back to my childhood dentist in Murrysville and explained what was happening. He looked at my teeth, then at my x-rays from six months earlier. He removed his glasses, bowed his head, and rubbed his eyes with his hand. This is never a good sign. Then he looked up and said, pretty much verbatim: ""Your cavities were not that deep, if you had cavities at all. That area showed no decay six months ago. You have virtually no tooth left- it is just enough to hold the filling. Go back and see what he can do- if the guy offers you a root canal, get outta there (alternately he could fill my teeth with a sedative). I don't know how this guy sleeps with himself. ""I went back, and lo and behold Dr Relis did offer me a root canal - in fact, insisted I NEEDED one right away, and began putting my chair back so he could begin his work (apparently he just happens to have this kind of availability in his schedule midday). You see... root canals are very, very costly. As are the crowns that often follow them depending on the level of damage to the tooth, which in my case was, well, rather severe. Apparently the good dentist prefers to keep such work in house.Of course I left.Montage: Two sedative fillings courtesy of my childhood dentist, two root canals and two crowns through an endodontist he recommended, one visit to a lawyer (did I have a case? absolutely. would I recoup my $$ after paying him? never.) and about 7k later, I finally had comfort in my teeth. Lucky I had charged the initial bill on my credit card and was able to ensure that absolutely ZERO dollars of that went to Dr Relis. I could say much, much more about the desire to break legs and what have you, but I think that breaks Yelp TOS.In a nutshell: Choose your dentist very carefully. Drive far for a good one. And for the love of all that's holy, don't let this guy near your teeth.",42,6,oUnNJ211DegK-hRfvAQQfw,1/16/2010,1,3,13,Health & Medical

I have never had a massage in my life and I was very nervous, but I was willing to give it a shot. The price was right, and I had my first massage this past week. I was booked with Megan, the owner, for Wednesday after work.The website was easy to use and looked very professional. The three therapists on there had brief bios that made sense to me. I was very surprised by other reviews who seem to not know the difference between Rene and Renee. HE even says in his bio that HE is a MAN. (To clarify this, perhaps a head shot of each employee with his or her bio be used.) I snagged the address and map from the website and found it quickly near the edge of Old Town Scottsdale near Olive Garden. The business is small. If you expect some huge salon place, go elsewhere. Tranquil Massage is for the personal, small business touch so missing in today's consumer market. There is a similar business that shares some office space, but everyone was very nice and it was very calm.I entered the front office where I was met by Megan who asked me to fill out a simple form detailing my health history (just the basics) and any meds I may be on. Then she led me into a smaller, clean room with a heated massage table, crisp, clean sheets and tranquil, quiet music playing. There were no outside sounds from other rooms or the road. Megan was very professional and went over the sheet with me before and explained, in detail, what would happen during my massage.She stepped out before I disrobed and got into position on the table. She came back in after a few minutes and began working on my body in the manner she explained beforehand. The music played lightly, some instrumental and with vocals, I could not hear the street noise or anyone outside of the room, and Megan and I chatted through the hour I was on the table for my Swedish Massage.  She was very personable and friendly. Afterward, she explained that I needed to drink lots of water and that I should take a few minutes to relax before dressing. She excused herself at that point.A few minutes later I went out to the lobby where she gave me a sealed bottle of cold water to drink. Another massage therapist, Rene, came through the door. I was introduced to him, and he seemed very nice, too. I confirmed my next appointment time and left. I did read all of the other reviews on this page recently, and I was floored by some of the negativity. One person had written that she'd never been there, but she had the gall to leave a review. I think that's against Yelp's policy. That reviewer said she didn't like Megan's responses to reviews, so I read them closely. I saw a professional, small business owner directly addressing every single concern every reviewer had on Yelp. Yes, this is a small business. I think there are four employees. It's in a shared space, too. Yes, Rene is a man. It says that in several places on the webpage. The online appointment system clearly has the information including address (I love online email reminders!).

We finally got a room, they asked some questions, and told us they didn't do IVs. They said the doctor would be in soon to see her. We waited and waited. There was literally almost no other patients in the entire place. None. We didn't see anyone who didn't work there. I even opened the door and kept it open so I could wait for someone and they didn't forget us. After another hour of not being seen, my daughter was really cranky. One of the employees came over and told us we had to close the door because she was too disruptive. They said the doctor would be in. We already paid our $50.00 or we would've walked out. The reason she was cranky was she was hungry so we finally fed her one of those kid nutrition bars. After another half an hour the doctor came in and said that they only thing they could do for her was an abdomen x-ray. We weren't too happy, but we agreed. They did the x-ray and after another half an hour (it's pushing 4-5 hours now!) the doctor came in and told us she had a mass in her abdomen that was larger than she'd ever seen! She had already called our pediatrician who immediately called our cell phone and told us we needed to get her to Children's Hospital downtown immediately. We were terrified and so was out doctor. We drove up there really fast through the rain; they took her in, sedated her, gave her an IV (something Urgent care should be able to do!), and ran a CatScan. After the doctor came in to read the results, he asked if she'd eaten recently. Of course, she had. After hours of waiting for an urgent care doc. The mass the stupid urgent care doctor saw was her food bar she'd eaten! She was fine and went home. We have never been back.Then this past weekend our friend's son split open his knee at his sister's birthday party, and the mom immediately took him to urgent care. I wasn't there yet, or I would've stopped them from going to NextCare. But they went down to NextCare for stitches. Two hours later they called us and told us they'd just gotten into the room. A half an hour later they called back and told us the NextCare does not do stitches and they were sent to the hospital. I can't believe it. What good is an Urgent care that can't see patients quickly, can't sew up an incision, can't use IVs, and can't tell the patient to leave before taking their money.

There is usually a steady entering of people coming to discuss your procedure and answer questions so write them down before you get here, because if you are like me it quickly escapes your memory when they ask if you have any questions. The waiting room is very large and has regular size chairs as well as a few small benches. If you have other small children accompanying you then this bench is great for sleepy children. the lounge area has 2 tables with chairs if you would want a table for eating or computer. also one table has a few electrical outlets for recharging your cell battery or computer laptop.  They have a free machine that can make different kinds of coffee, hot tea and even hot chocolate. There is also a TV in this area.The bathrooms are very large but are single file type so gotta wait if in use.the cafeteria downstairs is renovated and I am sorry that I cant tell you about the food there because it closes at 2pm! after lunch SO if your procedure is scheduled around lunch time then people who are allowed to eat should keep this in mind!ALSO keep in mind parents that if you are being admitted to HEMBY you may want to move your car from the orthopedic hospital parking deck to the main hospital during the time your child is in surgery. I get lost trying to maze my way through the hospital so I have to walk around the outside. And if you are by yourself at the hospital then you will be walking with your child to their room.the recovery room is typical, except that the pediatric ""cubbies"" are right next to the automatic door which is very loud when people come in and out.NOW onto the main hospital:We have usually always been admitted to HEMBY, which has its own elevator near the parking garage entrance to the hospital, take note that the entrance to the cafeteria is also near here.Hemby is a very nice place, there is a lot for your kids to do if able, playroom, birds to look at in there little glass houses. the rooms are typically adorned with a DVD player and movies are available to borrow. a fridge and microwave in some rooms too. which is great if you have a small one you cant leave.Now on this visit we were actually in the NEW Hemby overflow which is accessed by the B elevator located directly behind receptionist in main lobby. These rooms are large and have the sleeper sofa, but down fall is no fridge or microwave. but there is a TV of course with a vcr/dvd player. The food service person will visit you on the next food serving time and get your order for the next meals. The menu they give you is the one you will be making choices from for you stay. There is a lot to choose from. and as a parent I enjoyed that I didn't have to leave my child to go hunt food.the nurses have been awesome and respectful of listening to my instructions for how to care for my son. They are helpful to make sure his pain is under control and get whatever I need. FOOD Room served: not so bad! let me say that condiments help a great deal and this hospital uses mainly Kraft products (BBQ sauce, dressings, mayo) in the cafeteria you can get hot sauce, tartar sauce, creamers (flavored). of course salt and pepper.the mac and cheese is surprisingly great! just a little salt and pepper! The salads are filling. the chicken fingers remind me of Arby's breading. The flank steak with baked potato was edible, a little dry on the meat but hey it was free. The baked herbed chicken breast was also a little dry but very good. Breakfast was the best I think, I had eggs, bacon, sausage and grits. Cafeteria- salad bar is paid for by WEIGHT so keep that in mind. they now have sushi available, fruits, pastries and the hot section is per item unless you get the special. (like bacon is 49 cents a slice!). burgers are OK, i usually hit it with some of the seasoning salt used for the fries. which are great when first made. They have pizza, soups and sandwiches and this place opens late hours also. Gift shop has a lot to offer, snacks, headache meds, stomach meds, chap-stick. perfume, flowers, nice gifts, books, magazines. and extremely helpful staff.ATM is located on the first floor but the cafeteria and gift shop do take credit/debit cards so if your card is NOT signed be prepared to show ID, it is their policy! So if you should be admitted to the children's sections of the hospital I hope you a speeding recovery and a pleasant experience like I have received many times.",0,1,iB9MlR7m-cOZxICGVIyJWQ,12/17/2011,4,0,42,Health & Medical

I did do some rearranging of the furniture to accomidate my son's wheelchair and the needs for me to get around.

I've been to another boxing gym before (Title) but never 9Round. I've been seeing them spring up rather rapidly all over town and, at the same time, thinking I should check out a boxing/kickboxing gym. After checking out the website I went in for my free trial.They don't do your free trial any different from a normal session here. You come in and are instantly swept up into the circuit-style workout. Yes, it's basically a circuit. But you won't be using funky machines with weights and pulleys. It's more realistic. Using your own body and weight, jumping, squatting, crunching, lifting, punching and kicking to name a few. I'll admit I was overwhelmed. Apparently the day I'd chosen to come it was some kind of ""kicking cancer"" promo. It's a small place and it was packed to the brim.The website makes it seem like you'll have a trainer following along with you the whole time but you won't if it's packed like this. They bounce around from ""round"" to ""round"" (what they call each stop on the circuit). They may come by with a few words of encouragement to push you harder or even come by with an unexpected modification to the standard workout on the wall at each stop. Maybe they'll hold mats for you to kick or punch. Maybe they'll add a kick to your sit-ups.I decided to sign up for the two week promo at $30 to see if I'm still interested after that. For 6 months, at the time of writing this, the cost is $500. That includes a pair of boxing gloves that are yours to keep (and use here of course). So, in about two weeks, we'll see if I'm still interested in the seriously intense workout they have here.I can't finish this review without making the shout-out to Craig, the owner. He was very attentive from the moment I came in. He's encouraging but won't necessarily go easy on you. He takes your fitness goal seriously, and he seems to never forget your name.

But at least the same can be said for their menswear too.The vibe this place throws off is seriously chill. I spoke to Hal, one of the shop keepers, and he talked at length about chi-running/walking and how you can get a free course for it at their partner place next door (Okra) when you buy a pair of their shoes here. This guy was the epitome of modern day hippie (I hope that classification won't offend him, it's a compliment in my book). Very chill! You are also greeted with their perpetually running essential oil diffusions that fill the air with something to put you at ease.Returning to what they've got, they are purveyors of all things yoga, most things running and a few other lifestyle knick-knacks and hygiene/body related stuff. The shoes are certainly a unique selection focusing more on minimalism/barefoot-feel and therefore a stronger bond with the Earth. They range from gym to road and trail running shoes and include some ultra-minimal flip-flops (just when you thought they couldn't get any more simple). Clothing includes, as mentioned above, tights, sports bras (not my thing), shorts and pants, super-soft shirts, excellent athletic socks with zero-cotton options, head/hair bands and more. You've got all manner of rollers and trigger point balls for the runners out there trying to soften up post-run stiff muscles.

I was looking for a new dentist and got turned away from a few full clinics. My coworker recommended Southlake because it's been her dentist for many years and I can see why. My experiences here have been the absolute best.I had my old dentist forward over my dental records and it all went smoothly. I don't have any dental issues (thank god) to complain about coming over to this new clinic. So really my experience has been for the 6 month cleanings so far. They have 7:20 AM slots open on some weekdays which means I can get into work usually right after 8:00 AM and not have to make up much time.On my most recent visit I had some chips in my front tooth that got repaired (just like a previous reviewer). Had a run-on with a fork and...well I lost. Dr. Sloan did a quick epoxy patch on the cracks and it's really amazing. You can't tell there was ever a problem. He finished this up in less than 30 minutes. Out the door it was about $55. Of course the biannual check-ups are covered by my insurance so no expense there.The waiting room here is super cozy with some leather chairs that practically eat you alive when you sit in them. There's a TV in the waiting room and one in each exam room where the hygienist will quickly offer you a remote to put on whatever you want. (Usually I just want to turn it off, haha!)

Most recently it was at the Charlotte 10 Miler in Balantyne. But the most memorable time was back in the summer at the 24 Hours of Booty ride in Charlotte. One of their doctors(?) was on site doing massage, stretching and perhaps mild adjustments and giving some consultation advice. I felt thoroughly pleased with the service and took a card swearing I'd be into the clinic to have a full review of my physical well being. Well being is perhaps not the best wording to use though, as I'm physically just tense and broken everywhere.I've been to a very basic chiropractor before. By basic I mean they churn you out like you're on an assembly line. Wait in a waiting room, they say ""next"", you come in, crack your neck and back and send you away in about 10 minutes or less. That's it. But that's not CSC. Here they go above and beyond ""basic chiropractor"". Before you get an adjustment you'll go through an orientation of sorts where they analyze how you're standing or sitting or whatever you're doing wrong to hurt yourself. They'll give you a list of exercises to do when you're not in the clinic getting adjusted or stretched. In the clinic they will do a light sort of massage to loosen up and stretch out your tense muscles prior to performing an adjustment on you. After a thorough adjustment you will be attached to some electrodes (I'm not sure specifically what the device is called) which vibrate your muscles to help relieve a bit of the potential pain after your adjustment. At least in my case they applied some KT tape as a ""gentle reminder"" to maintain my proper posture to prevent the pain from recurring so frequently.They're very friendly and accommodating and have an almost communal layout here for the physical therapy/chiropractic functions. I do pay quite a bit more than I did with my previous chiropractor ($65/visit here) however I'd say it's worth the improved quality of the treatment. As I loosen up more and build up the courage I may try some dry needling to see if that works too. But really, I'm just learning more about my body's ""bad habits"" and ways at this point - they do an excellent job of sharing that.

I went to have a cyst removed on my hand. For a separate appointment to have the bunions on my feet checked out and ask some plantar fasciitis questions. I know, I'm 29 and I'm already falling apart. Thirty here I come!Initially I thought my regular doctor set up one appointment for both. That's not on OrthoCarolina - my regular doctor screwed me over. That ended up meaning two separate appointments and (naturally) twice the price. I also found out the doctors specialize so the guy that does hands won't do feet and vice versa. Something to keep in mind. Appointment #1 went smoothly. I immediately got an X-ray done. The doctor talked kind of fast and used words I don't understand. In short it meant: you have a cyst in a common place and we usually stick it with a cortisone shot a few times before resorting to surgery. I got the shot - feels weird - and now it doesn't hurt anymore but the cyst is very much still there. That's kinda weird. They said ""give it 6 weeks and it should go down"". So we'll see.Appointment #2 for the feet went about the same way. My plantar fasciitis has been gone for a couple weeks but it was bad before. Bunions are genetic for me and surgery is inevitable. They took a lot more X-rays (my feet look pretty neat on the inside). The doctor talked fast and said a lot of things just from looking at the X-ray, some of which I don't really agree with. But who am I? Not the doctor! ""Plantar fasciitis is not usually weight related."" was the one that stuck out to me. After losing 10-15 lbs I can't imagine it's coincidental that the PF is gone. But whatever. Surgery was put on the table as an option for the bunions - it would make a difference.The one key point here is they leave the decision up to you, the patient. They don't insist ever that you need surgery or a shot or other treatment. Simply: Does it hurt? Does it impact your daily life? If the answer is yes, here are your options... My bunions aren't killing me. Surgery isn't imminent. The cyst definitely needed a cortisone shot though. Like with other doctor's offices, I wish the prices were not so hidden or vague. It would be nice to get a treatment estimate coming in here. Just like if you went in for surgery or brought a car to the shop. I have to imagine there isn't a single price for one X-ray or ten. It probably goes up for each image. Last suggestion: doctors should slow down and give patients time to process what they're hearing and share the background of their situation more. Otherwise, office staff in particular are super friendly and helpful!",2,1,O5PfbKghx03CSspkTK3SkA,10/11/2017,3,2,-3,Health & Medical

My hygenist was also very sweet, kept me comfortable with her chatting and not too rough with the tools.  I mentioned that I was thinking of going to Charleston soon for a trip and she called over another hygenist who is a frequent visitor, then proceeded to take diligent notes for me while I was in the chair.  The dentist I saw was also for the most part pleasant, but that's where the mixed feelings come in.  See, the hygenist asked at the beginning of my visit if I was ""happy with my smile"".  I mentioned a couple of things that I might look into fixing and she left it there.  But the dentist went ahead and pointed out some things - not health issues, mind you, I wouldn't have minded that, but sort of little cosmetic things, like a small line I have on one tooth - that left me with a bit of a furrowed brow.  Yeah, I was aware of those things but I'd already talked about the things that I wanted fixed.

If you are going to Rankin for prenatal care and delivery, there is a team of 7 doctors (although I think one of them only practices at the Ballantyne location) and you will be encouraged to meet all of them as any one of them could be on call when you deliver.  I will say that I felt comfortable with all of the doctors.  They all exuded calmness, which was important to me.  Dr. Palermo actually ended up delivering me and her deadpan wit was the perfect thing to get me through the process.  I'd planned on an unmedicated birth, and the doctors were all supportive.  It wasn't until I went into labor and had a personal change of heart that I went for pain meds and they were supportive of that too.  I never felt like I was bullied or strong-armed into making a choice, and whenever I had questions they were answered to my satisfaction.  My pregnancy was pretty uneventful so I never really got to see them work in a crisis though.

After quick, friendly and professional attention, I was sipping OJ, eating a cookie and walking out with a free loaf of Panera bread (on Thursdays and Fridays) under my arm in less than an hour.I won't suggest that you'll get through that quickly but, if you can, donating blood should be a thing.

Because he is in his 50s they needed to rule out stroke, etc. The nursing staff, techs, and doctors were very caring. We could see that there was so much going on trauma-wise so it was understandable that since we had a stable condition, we had to wait. I am a registered nurse and have been one since 1972. I also have taught customer service and medical assistants. Believe me, I am used to finding fault when a doctor's office or facility doesn't meet my high expectations, so I was pretty amazed and thrilled that my husband and I received great respect.People who came in with drug related conditions, or those who had to be accompanied by law enforcement also were treated well.You can hear everything while seated behind a curtain!My husband got a bed on the 4th floor and remained there for a few days.Everything was good: staff were helpful and very good at explaining any delays regarding testing or doctors' visits.This RN did not expect the calibre of care at UMC. We had only been in Nevada for a year, so we hardly knew where to go.We have insurance with my job, and one may think that there could be a different treatment for those who have coverage, or who speak English, or seem to understand what is going on, but every individual I saw was given the utmost respect. Of course there were direct conversations and admonishments to those who made crazy life choices, or had two cops in the cubicle, but each interaction was dignified. I was so impressed.Dr. Wangsuwana, the neurologist, is a dream come true: he dove into a medical history with many issues but translated what was going on very clearly, and found errors which had been made by doctors out of state. We subsequently visited Dr. Wangsuwana just to have him become my husband's neurologist. Dr. Wangsuwana is brilliant but his manner is caring and he treated us very well.This was a great experience.

I had an evening appointment and I had just finished a day at my job of office monkey.  I had changed into a t-shirt because being in full office gear for 3 more hours was seriously going to chafe my morale. This meant I had minimal make up on, hair styled about 10 hours ago, and khaki pants.   I was asked no more than 3 times if I was over 18 years old (uh I'm out of college). I ended up volunteering to have the receptionist examine my driver's license!  Oddly everyone but the optometrist had some comment to make about my age or my appearance. (how effing rude, just look at my eyes and get me through the herd, yo)Next infraction... the REFUSAL to explain FEES upfront.  I had asked how much the exam would be and I explain I am there for both glasses and contacts.  AFTER I finish the exam -- I am curtly told that if I want contacts the fitting fee is an additional $80. (um I did want contacts and I did tell you that.)  I ask them to reduce the fee and am told to call back in the morning.    Third infraction... after bringing in my YEAR old glasses to get the lenses replaced, I am told that the frames are too ""cracked"" to receive new lenses.  Funny how the next optometrist I went to didn't have that problem.Fourth infraction.. After getting quotes from 3 other eye care facilities, I end up calling the next morning to ask about receive a reduced fee for a contact fitting.  I am told that the ""fitting"" they provide is superior service to all others in Madison and refuse to give me a reduced price, even after I explained that I was not fully informed of the fees.  (and EVERYWHERE is is between $30-40 less)This Lenscrafters is an abomination to all others.

The good news is that there was no pain; the bad involved my experience at First Choice Dental on South Park Street.  I am only giving a rating of two stars because the receptionists were extremely polite and kind.  I spoke to one of them on the phone for at least 5 minutes as we tried to arrange a time for me to come in.  After my interactions with them the politeness stopped and the bullying began.  The dental assistant was more interested in fixing her computer monitor that was crapping out than the patient. She crammed the X-Ray machine in my mouth and basically told me to tough it out while she fiddled with another computer for at least 2 minutes. (which is a really long time when some huge machine is chafing your effing mouth)  The dentist explained to me that I would need an expensive crown for about $1600.  He tried rationalizing it to me that it was ""mere pennies a day"" as this crown was going to last me 20 years. Additionally, the dentist (thinking that I was one of those uninsured eccentric millionaires) suggested that I get 4 of my other fillings replaced too as they were cracking.  Both of these people seemed to not hear me say at least 4 times, ""I'm not insured.""  I requested a temporary filling for the problem tooth no less than 3 times in which the dentist flat out refused.  At the end, I was ushered into a room where they discussed finances with me, and suggested that perhaps I ask my parents for help in order to get a crown or maybe I could take out a loan from a bank that they endorsed.  I hope it was that they just hate poor people, and they treat insured people better. (who probably have no choice but First Choice)",29,0,Hfr4Z3Y-hYtgV6mdxc5GZg,8/5/2007,2,2,-1,Health & Medical

That sounded good until I got there after work & he pulls out the polish & literally was going to just polish over the chips in nails & put back under lamp, I stopped him & said that is not going to work, they will chip even faster, he started getting aggressive grabbing my hand to drill polish off saying ""he got it & he knows what he's doing"". We got into a slight argument because I'm trying to ask him what is he going to do different because obviously what he did the 1st time didn't. Long story short he drilled (not soaked) polish off of 5 chipped nails, quickly re-polished nails & guess what?!?!? By Wed (not 48 hrs later) 3 more nails have chips.

I've continued to give this place chances over the last 1 1/2 yrs, also referring many friends to go as well.

I said something to her about this being it was 8:05 pm & she stated her husband Vince would do my nails, he came over & aggressively started scrapping the polish off my nails & I stated to him that I don't understand why he is now doing my nails after I have waited for all their appts & walk ins to get taken care of and now I am being put off again.  LISA started yelling over his shoulder to me what she was doing, which was completely unacceptable!!! I always pay & tip very well at this place but LISA & VINCE are rude & tried to justify why I was still not being taken care of at 8 pm.  I watched several clients come in & ask for services that DID NOT have a appt, along with the ones with appts, but she wanted to argue with me that all of them had appts, which was a flat out lie. I got up & left, letting them know that I would never return & will let everyone know of their lack of customer service, especially to a long time client.  Lisa then wanted to start a text war with me, arguing back & forth for the next hour through the phone.  An apology means nothing when all you had to do from the beginning was say ""we won't be able to get you in today"" instead of having me there for 3 hrs & leaving with my nails half scrapped off with polish.  They are greedy & time management is horrible.  If you simply tell someone up front what the wait time will be this would have never happened, but to yell at me once I said something about it will never fly in my book.  They lost a great client due to lack of professionalism & customer service. LISA also then wanted to talk about me to 2 of my friends that go there as well, again VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

Instead I asked them to instead find a nice room in the tower.  Forget the fancy bathtub (although a shower would be nice!).I just wanted a close room that was clean and somewhat spacious. And I got just that for the little time I actually spent in the room. I probably spent more time getting work done in the lounge.

Also never had time to use my 25% coupon (given to me at check-in) at the spa- double drats.Just 2 little complaints:1) The free internet service was spotty, which can drive a workaholic like myself absolutely insane.2) They changed their security system while I was there, which meant none of the original room keys worked. I walked ALL THE WAY to my room to discover my key didn't work and then had to walk ALL THE WAY back to the lobby to see what the deal was. Couldn't the nice man who greeted me when I first walked in the lobby warn me about the key problem?

We don't have to pay for TRX classes at my gym at home, but apparently it's a new class here. When we first checked in they told us the class was taking place on the rooftop of the gym. We headed on up and realized it was outside. Being a Chicagoan I feel silly being worried about being cold in 60 degree weather, but we did hesitate taking the class due to it being outside.  Ultimately, we decided to give it a shot and hoped Heidi would get us warmed up quickly.  Heidi did just that and within minutes I was loving the temps, not to mention the opportunity to be outside in January. Amazing!! Rumor has it Heidi is a popular instructor and I can see why. She's challenging, motivating and focused on form so you know you're actually doing the moves correctly.  If I lived in the area I'd likely sign up for this class on a weekly basis....or...maybe Heidi's classes that are a bit later in the morning. The rest of the gym was absolutely packed.

The architect of record is Albert Chase McArthur, who was once one of Wright's draftsmen and obviously he was heavily influenced by his employer and mentor. In fact, Wright consulted McArthur for a few months in the textile block construction which is one of the hotel's architectural trademarks. But let's get real. As talented as McArthur was, the owners knew Wright was the one with the marquee name and have played up the connection big time ever since its construction.To reinforce the same misconception I had, they added a signature Wright-designed stained glass in the lobby (photo: http://bit.ly/2wOrfC5) and the familiar Japanese-influenced stone sprites from Wright's Midway Gardens project in Chicago (photo: http://bit.ly/2fpJ7AJ), as well as naming the three onsite Restaurant after Wright, including one that celebrates the actual architect, Frank & Albert's - even though poor McArthur gets second billing (photo: http://bit.ly/2horLVx). Driving here at night from Camelback, I couldn't tell how close I was getting to the hotel until I saw a small sign at a creek crossing (photo: http://bit.ly/2xBj9kg).The entrance was designed in the familiar prairie style accented by intricately designed blocks (photo: http://bit.ly/2ylbQu6). The low ceiling of the expansive lobby is covered completely in gold leaf, and the lamps, rugs and couches are all typically Wright in their angular and orb-focused design (photo: http://bit.ly/2xoc6Mi). Strolling outside to the back terrace, I saw more sprites and sat on a Morris chair that served nicely as a lounge seat. The hotel has changed hands a number of times and is now part of the high-end Waldorf-Astoria collection. Hell, I didn't stay here but rates start at $265 per night for a standard guest room to around $800 for a villa. Well worth a stop and a stroll even if you're not a guest.",7,8,8PX_cHMJVi3-5y3vPY_aqA,9/23/2017,4,4,1,Beauty & Spa

No question. and if that is what you are looking for, fantastic. four stars. but they should highlight that, and not try to fruitlessly pitch themselves as a gym for 20- and 30-somethings who are looking for a well-rounded/cross training experience. Unless of course you only want aerobic machines. they have those in spades.However... if they DID want to make this place serve that population, a) you need to have a TRX station that allows the straps to hang down and for people to work out below the anchor point. and if you aren't, you need to have enough space away from the anchor point such that you aren't right in the flow of foot traffic or nearly hovering over a machine. I love they you guys have TRX, but you gotta give it some room to breath.b) the climbing wall is definitely for kids (5.6 - 5.10a). I think there is one 5.11 (guessing 5.11a) and it's not very tall but they have the ability to set some routes (don't need many, one or two would be great) that really challenge people. Also, the flooring material is not a mat but rather that shredded rubber which for bouldering is almost asking for a sprained ankle.c) make the more unique items (Bosu balls, medicine balls, bands, etc.) more accessible and give people much more space to use them. even the personal training space isn't very large. which would be frustrating if you paid for PT and had to wait to use equipment.Don't get me wrong, the pool is fun and the outdoor option is great, but definitely geared toward kids. shame they couldn't put in long lap lanes but waterslides are pretty popular with the 10 and under crowd.",5,2,T2xaR0ppKwuElE1aNkW77Q,11/16/2016,3,1,20,Beauty & Spa

Then started reading reviews on Illuminati. The reviews were all good, so I made the decision to go there. Met Dras, who explained the piercing process, where the piercing needed to be placed symmetrically on my nose, the cleaning process, and answered all my questions thoroughly, with kindness, and patience. The piercing was over quickly (I have had three c-sections, so I always rate pain by that. :D) and while it did hurt, it wasn't up there with recovering from major surgery. The final result is that I am so much happier with the new piercing, where it is placed on my nose, and have a much better understanding of how to care for it. Thanks Dras!

His regular place was closed for the day so as usual, I turned to Yelp for life advice. This place was close by (then again, for this Miami girl, everything is close by in a town like this), had decent reviews, and wasn't going to break the bank. We walked in and were told it would be about a 30 minute wait, which was no problem since we were a walk-in on the weekend. Upon checking-in, Yelp offered me a free MVP upgrade. I'm still kind of confused as to what this means, and the employees were very confused about my check-in offer, since literally no one had ever seen it before. Plus, they said, ""all our new clients automatically get the free upgrade"". We just needed a regular haircut, but I guess we were getting the MVP upgrade which meant a shampoo, hot face towel, and shoulder massage.The stylist did a great job and was very personable. She chatted with my nephew and made sure he was happy with the end result.The problem came to when we paid and were charged for the upgrade which was supposedly free for first timers, plus I also had the Yelp check-in offer. Nope, those were just for the upgrade on the upgrade, or something of the sort. So I took my 15 year old nephew to a sports-themed supercuts for a basic haircut and ended up spending $30 for bells and whistles that we didn't expect or even need. He doesn't care about a warm towel on his face! His regular place charges $8, I wish they would have been more clear from the beginning. Again, the haircut was good and the stylist was friendly.

Their hotel lobby lounge features a 32-foot long chandelier, draped by an elegant staircase. There's a few stores, and a Starbucks overlooking the lobby. The casino's decor is sharp, and the Restaurant lining it mirror that theme. The nearly 3,000 slot machines can confound if you're trying to find people, so pay attention to your surroundings.We had a spacious suite near the spa, with a view of the Strip and top-notch amenities: modern decor, huge soft mattresses, a comfy couch, a widescreen plasma TV, and a convenient bottle of Patron (costs extra). Loved the bathroom, and the luxurious shower. The toilet had a phone by it, and the marble tub, a TV. Besides hearing wind whistling one morning (it was crazy windy out there), Red Rock's hotel, casino, and lounges all had a fit and finish that made our dollars feel well-spent.Hotel service was stellar. When I needed help late-night, both Tanya (at the front desk) and a bellhop assisted. When we needed a random feminine hygiene product, not only did room service stock necessities, a staffer delivered the goods to our door minutes later.

When we got there, we were ushered into a dimly lit room with comfortable armchairs to sit in. A big wooden tub is brought out with a plastic bag lined and filled with hot water to soak our feet in. My masseuse was Anna who immediately went to work on my back and shoulders. After about 10 mins on my upper back, I felt myself relax and slump over the cushions she had placed on my lap.I've had Chinese foot massage before but they've always hurt me so badly I couldn't go about my daily duties for a few days.

We had a good 30 minutes of back, neck and shoulder massage and then she moved onto your head, scalp and ears before doing the arms, hands and fingers. When that was finished she started working on my feet and toes. I actually fell asleep can you believe it? I've NEVER fallen asleep during one of these before.She then massaged my legs and then laid 3 ottomans together so we could lay on it face-down so she could work on my back. Throughout the treatment, I was drinking the herbal tea they had provided -- I suggest you do this because it will make you go and pee to flush out all the toxins in your body.When it was all over, I stood up and was wobbly. I lost my balance slightly because I was so relaxed. I'm going to give them 5 stars for the treatment, but am taking off a star because I didn't realize until later, they never gave us the Yelp discount. We received 15 minutes of extra treatment and were charged $48. We were told the Yelp discount would make the one hour treatment $34, so an extra 15 minutes should not cost 14 extra dollars.

I didn't get the great view of the towers of hotels of Circus Circus and the needle of the Stratosphere like I had from my first visit. All I get a view of the pool side (located one floor below) and deserted Koval Street. Other than the lack of the glamorous view from my first visit, my suite is pretty much the same. I did get a washer and dryer in my suite, plus a hair-dryer that I didn't get from my first visit. The hair-dryer was hanging in a bag inside the closet. The hair-dryer: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XwV2-lISDp_5Acy72bA8Qg?select=BlFNHSFqfw08KKC4TciaEAThis time around, I was able to walk around the hotel and check out the pool area. Also, I finally found the hotel's gym, located on the fourth floor. I needed to make room for the great food in my belly, and I had two awesome and intense one-hour morning run on the treadmill. I had the gym all to myself on both workout sessions. The gym: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XwV2-lISDp_5Acy72bA8Qg?select=ppIqFxTO5RmoBsO_n1jTQAThe hotel-lobby also has a canteen filled with a refreshing citrus-infused water for all guest.

As prevalent as foot massage establishments are becoming, I have to admit I was a Foot Massage Virgin until 2 months ago. And, I can say hands-down, the second time around at PF&S blew my first experience at SF's Wonderfoot Health Center out of the water!Although I love wearing stilettos, they do not love me and no matter how many GG shots I take to numb the pain, I end up wearing them as bracelets by midnight. As we were planning our Vegas trip, Nicole S. found PF&S and after seeing the 4.5 STAR rating, we knew we had to go there during out trip. Come Friday, 3.5.10, our feet were already sore from the previous night at Tryst, even though I had my shoes off half the time. *SIGH* If we (I), intended to survive the next 2 nights, we (I) needed a foot massage, and needed one badly! APPOINTMENT:Walk-ins are welcome. However, just to ensure they could accommodate me and my gfs, Nicole S. called at 3 PM for a same-day appointment at 3:30 PM.LOCATION:PF&S is in Chinatown and is located in one of those Asian Plaza's similar to the ones in the San Gabriel Area of LA. It's approximately a $13 cab ride (10 min) cab ride from the strip. EXPERIENCE:1) We were warmly welcomed in by the staff and seated in leather recliners side-by-side each other.2) I received a cup of rose tea while Anna, my masseuse prepared the footbath.3) While my feet soaked in the footbath, I sat on the ottoman while she worked on my head, face, neck, shoulders, upper and lower back. It was by far the BEST non-oil massage I've ever had! Anna used trigger point therapy on my head, temples, and neck and I could feel the pent up stress just melt away. On my shoulders and back, she used a combo of acupressure and long strokes to knead away all the knots I had. I especially loved it when she used her entire forearm and went back and forth against each backbone...it felt so good, it made my EYES-ROLL-IN-BACK-OF-MY-HEAD!4) After 25 minutes, Anna dried off my feet, and had me sit back on the recliner and gave me a hand and arm massage which consisted of acupressure, kneading, and strokes. The hand massage was blissful and brought me back memories of my rave days!5) After 5 minutes, Anna went to the best part....the FOOT AND LEG MASSAGE! She put a balm on my feet and calves that felt a mixture of cream and shea butter. It was velvety smooth and intensified the effect of the massage even more. She started with trigger point therapy on certain parts of my feet, and then followed it with long strokes on the arch of my foot. I have many problems with the balls of my feet, so when Anna went to town on this part, it was Ahhhhhhhh, ORGASMIC!6) The last 2 minutes, ended with a thigh massage where Anna kneading my thigh with her fists. SERVICE:The staff at PF&S are very friendly, professional, and can speak conversational English (so there shouldn't be any awkward laguage barriers). Anna was very sweet and asked several times if I was ok and if the pressure was good. The pressure was perfect; it was gentle yet firm on the knots that needed to be worked out. PRICE:The decal outside the window stated $28 for 45 minutes, but we did the $38 for 1 hour. The staff at PF&S works hard, so please be mindful and tip accordingly. :)AMBIANCE:No frills establishment w/ a very simple and relaxing atmosphere. There are two flat LCDs on the Chinese CNN channel (muted) and Chinese classical music playing in the background. There are two rows of leather recliners; 10 total. We'll definitely be back on our next Vegas trip in 3 months! Vegas was a blast as usual and I definitely accomplished one of my goals: Happy Ending @ Vegas....CHECK! No pun intended of course...",31,20,oku3HsB2aq967SMqkPWD2A,3/10/2010,5,20,34,Beauty & Spa

I guess that's what I get for Waking Up In Vegas...As you can imagine, my debauchery from the previous night left me severely hungover so after getting a bite to eat at Grand Lux Cafxc3xa9, my friend suggested that we all go to Canyon Ranch Spa Club for some ""Steam Therapy"".  On Saturday, 2.19.11, we (party of six) came to CRSC at around 1 PM. There are two employees at the front desk. It took about 10 minutes to check-in and pay. There's a women, men and co-ed section in the spa. We stayed at the women's only section. FEE$40/day pass to use the gym and spa facilities. HOWEVER, it's only $20/person if your hotel room (Palazzo or The Venetian) is charged with a resort fee. If it's not, I highly recommend you paying the $17.95 one-time resort fee at the spa because it will cover everyone in your party. My friend paid the resort fee, so we ended up saving about $17/person. LOCKER ROOMYou will be provided a magnet key wristlet to access your locker. Your robe will be provided in your locker. TIP: BRING YOUR OWN SLIPPERS/FLIP FLOPS! TRUST ME!The pressure point slippers that's provided are the most UNCOMFOTABLE slippers ever! With each step, it felt like I was walking on pebble stone pavement. EVERYONE was complaining about how painful they were and that we were better off wearing out 5-inch stilettos from the previous night...no joke! I hated those slippers so much, I wanted to BURN mine after leaving!AQUAVANA THERMAL ENVIRONMENTSVarious aquathermal environments that are designed to help with muscle relaxation, increase oxygen flow and most importantly RID YOUR BODY OF TOXINS! The perfect ""morning after"" remedy after a night of copious drinking!ROOM #1: IGLOOExactly as the name says, it's basically a big freezer. My least favorite of all the rooms because of the cold temperature. ROOM #2: JACUZZ WITH HEATED LOUNGERSThe jacuzzi (bathing suit optional) could accommodate about 8-10 people. I LOVED the heated loungers (there were 6). They were made of some type of Styrofoam material that was firm yet soft. The loungers were so warm and comforting that I could have slept on it the whole day.ROOM #3: HERBAL  LACONIUM (WET STEAM ROOM) - HANGOVER CURE!!!!!If you're not use to humid heat, the Herbal Laconium room may be too much to handle in the beginning. HOWEVER, after several minutes, your body will adjust to the heat and it will become very bearable.  As I closed my eyes, breathed in deeply and exhaled, I could feel my body releasing all the tequila and goose through my pores and my pounding headache becoming fainter and fainter.  TIP: Drink plenty of water beforehand and pick up an iced towel (to cover your face) in the Jacuzzi room which will make it much easier to breathe in the steam room.  ROOM #4: Finnish Sauna (Dry Heat Room)Not a fan of dry heat rooms as I feel like I'm stuck in a charcoal bbq minus the charcoal. ROOM #5: Crystal Steam Room (Aromatherapy Steam Room)Saving the best for last! The aromatherapy steam room is less intense than the Herbal Laconium room and the fragrant floral scents will enhance your mood. THE QUIET ROOM/LOUNGEEnd your Aquavana Session at the quiet room where you can lay on plushy oversized sofas while reading trashy magazines and munching on fresh apples, bananas and oranges. It was so quiet and serene that I ended up taking a 10-minute power nap. I woke up refreshed with my pounding headache all gone!SHOWER/MAKEUP ROOM*10-15 private showers with shampoo, conditioner and body wash in each one*Personal sink area with lotions, deodorant, hair care products, hair dryer, combs, brushes, etc*If you need a curling iron or flat iron, you can get it at the front deskTIP: If you need a razer, shower cap, and/or towels, make sure to grab them before getting into the shower room. They're located near the entrance way to the showers.OVERALL LAYOUTThe CRSC is BIG and I didn't even know how big until I got lost and ended up on the men's side. It's confusing to say the least and it was like a maze to get out. If you suffer from ""Waking Up In Vegas"" syndrome like I always seem to, I highly recommend coming to the CRSC to get you out of your funk!",12,3,dPXJNnBIYeIETYy01Euvbg,2/28/2011,3,7,23,Beauty & Spa

I'm no stranger to pain and enjoy deep pressure massages, so Chinese foot massages/reflexology are right up my alley b/c done right, a  ""good"" pain releases all the pent up tension. So with most of the reviews boasting how awesome Good Foot Spa was, I decided to pay them a visit during my Vegas trip.My friend and I came to GFS on Friday, 7.30.10 at 4 PM. We had made an appt one day prior.There's a standard process for a Chinese foot massage/reflexology. First, you're brought warm tea and crackers. You feet is then soaked in plastic lined bucket of warm water while you're given a head, neck, shoulder and arm massage. Your masseuse then massages your calves and feet and finishes by flipping you over on the recliner and giving a back and butt massage. So, it's actually a full body massage (clothed) and the foot massage portion is about 1/3 of the massage time.Although the process at GFS was similar to other massage places, the overall feeling and results were NOT.I wasn't able to get my masseuse's name b/c she didn't speak English. When I asked her in Cantonese if she understood, she replied back, ""I speak 'Chinese' "". Uhhh, ok...1. Instead of getting a head massage, my masseuse placed lotion onto the palm of her hands and rubbed it into my scalp. She then repeatedly SCRAPED MY SCALP WITH HER NAILS for 20 minutes. Needless to say, I was cringing in pain the entire time. 2. The neck and shoulder massage was probably the highlight of the entire massage. It lasted for about 10 minutes and strong kneading was used to release the pent up tension.3. My masseuse then massaged my arms for 10 minutes, which I can't even call it a ""massage"". She didn't bother to put lotion on my arms which resulted in my skin stretching and pulling (aka Indian Burn) as she forcefully ran her thumbs up/down my forearm. 4. Afterwards, she gave me a foot massage, but mainly concentrated on my calves. What little she did to my feet did nothing to relieve my sore feet. She used her thumbs to rub up/down my arch several times and cracked my toes. When she massaged my ankle, she dug her thumbs into it, which made my flinch in pain. 5. Finally, she flipped me over and gave me a back massage. She ran her forearm along my spine back and forth. I like strong pressure and although she used a lot of force, something about it just didn't feel right. PRICE:$38 for 60 minutes. CC's accepted, but they appreciate tip in cash. Oh yah, btw, I mentioned Yelp for the 10% off and they had no clue what I was talking about. I tried to explain that I saw a promo on their Yelp page and they thought I was looking for a person named ""Yelp"". :XAMBIANCE/Dxc3x89COR:GFS is clean however, it's very dark inside. There are about 4-5 small cheesy pink painted rooms w/ about 3 recliners in each. For the novice, it may look a bit shady. However, as with most Chinese foot massages you're paying for their services and not the ambiance, so a bare boned dxc3xa9cor w/ mix matched walls, linens, and furnishings is typical. I think we were the only ones there at the time, so it was pretty quiet except for the occasional exchange btw my masseuse and my friend's masseuse. However, as an fyi, when these foot massages places do get busy, the environment is not serene. WHY I WILL NEVER RETURN:I've been to about 7-8 different foot massage places in SF, LA, and LV and this one is definitely on the bottom of my list. Why? 80% of the time, my massage was uncomfortable and painful. I know the difference btw ""good"" and ""bad"" pain and my pain was the latter. I left with an itchy scalp and oily hair. And, 2-3 days later my inner right ankle became sore and bruised and my arms were tender to the touch.Oh, Yelp...what happened??? *Sigh*We should have went to Pure Foot and Spa down the road instead...http://www.yelp.com/biz/pure-foot-and-spa-las-vegas#hrid:oku3HsB2aq967SMqkPWD2A",12,5,_zOaJ9zZ80Pm-nT4syn_6g,8/11/2010,2,6,11,Beauty & Spa

Several friends raved about the experience with such remarks as ""opening up the Google search of your brain"" to ""feeling like the 1 hour mark after 'shroom tea"" to ""mentally going to Mars"".  Their levels of sobriety ranged from stone cold to having smoked an ounce in the parking lot.  I was somewhere in between.      The friendly attendant, John, clearly explained what to do and how to operate the pod.  Being a first timer, I also watched a 6 minute video on how to maximize my float time which offered some helpful suggestions (body position, breathing) while glazing over some new age, self improvement stuff.  John also informed me to hang in their relaxation room upon finishing since many feel disoriented and extremely euphoric afterwards.  Uhhh..what??  So I get out of the shower, put the ear plugs in, get in the pod.....""And I'm floating in a most peculiar way""I initially found the whole thing a bit comical.  Here I am...naked, in a dark and confined space, lying in 93.5 degree water...isn't this a torture method in Guantanamo Bay?  But after I got over the initial weirdness, things got interesting....   ""And the stars look very different today""It definitely felt like drifting in outer space.  My mind darted through a billion thoughts before I was able to end up in a kind of neutral, semi-conscious, relaxed zone.  I could not believe I was in the pod for only an hour as it felt much longer than that.They claim health benefits like the improvement of memory/sports performance/sleep quality, alleviating PMS, helping with creativity, softer skin etc.  Let me tell you....my PMS was fuckin loooong gooooone!!!  :P  I don't know about this experience helping with all that, but I definitely left in a prolonged state of relaxation.

After being sick of contacts and glasses for 15+ years, she finally wanted to get it done.After some research and speaking with a few facilities, it seemed like the best choice was either here or Lasik of Nevada.  We chose Siems based on our talk with the consultant, price for the exact same treatment and also their proximity to our home.  My wife didn't want to schlep it all the way to Henderson for follow ups.  Dr. Siems made us feel comfortable right away upon the first meeting.  His office is very nice.  The lobby feels spa-like.  Needless to say we were nervous when the big day finally came for her to get the procedure done.  You hear that there's a high 90% success rate but a person only has one pair of eyes.  Dr. Siems and his staff made my wife as comfortable as possible (valium helped).  I was able to view the whole procedure on a television outside of the operating room and it definitely made me wince a little when they cut the lens and started shooting the lasers in her eyes. The whole procedure took less than 30 minutes.  She then took another valium and slept for about 18 hours.  She was able to see very clearly the next day and it just improved from there.  Post operation checkups are included in the price so the day after, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year were all taken care of.  Now that it has been well over a year, she says it's one of the best things she's ever done in life.  I've worn glasses more than half of my life and feel like the fat guy at Mr Olympia or the dude with no tattoos in a tattoo parlor when I go in there.  They always ask me when I am going to do it.

Paolo D, Regina P, David S and Julie S all give very helpful and detailed reviews on how it'll all go down so you should read them.  I have a few things to add:- Bring flip flops.  They didn't supply them for me and I walked around barefoot the whole time.  It wasn't bad but I was running out of a couple of the sauna rooms really quickly since the floor was hot.   - No option for bathing suits.  You will be naked with everyone else.  I am very near sighted so everyone looks like they've been blurred out for public television.- Be VERY careful when getting into one of the beds in the red clay ball room.  It's like walking on a hundred marbles and the floor is not forgiving.  I wiped out pretty bad and strained my MCL.  My doctor said I'll be fine in a week.  Thanks to all that laughed at me (wife included).  I am going butt in first the next time.  - The signs say to use each sauna on the 2nd floor for 3-7 minutes.  You can definitely do a little longer than that.  But one guy fell asleep in the red clay ball room (you could hear him snoring) and I am guessing he was in there for a solid hour.  He looked like a total disaster when he came out.  Stay hydrated!- I never do this but I paid $1 for the 3 minute massage chairs.  There were 2 types.  One was the standard massage which was decent and the other was the ""slimming massage chair"" which was ridiculous.  The latter just started shaking your butt from left to right, up and down like you were going through terrible airplane turbulence and it also crushed your calves.  Definitely avoid that one.I know it sounds like I am just complaining but there's a lot to like about Imperial.  The steam rooms are great.  I enjoyed sitting in the sheer heat of the herbal steam room only to jump into the cold tub as soon as I got out.  It felt so refreshing!

My massage therapist told me that due to the addition of the Palazzo Tower they will eventually be the largest spa in the world at over 100,000 square feet... but that's not necessarily a good thing.   They have the requisite citrus waters and teas and yadda yadda but IMO, the money would be better spent on upgrades to the personal hygiene products they provide and lockers that don't take 4 tries to open (maybe that was just my particular locker but it sucked nonetheless)...   etc etc.   I cannot comment on their other services, like exercise, salon, et al...   but so far Bellagio still has my favorite spa, hands down.",1,1,s9XzwoOXAV58U9kvOiRTOQ,7/13/2008,2,1,23,Beauty & Spa

Major props for that. I arrived to my appointment and was happy to see that the salon looked just as nice in person as it does in photos. I picked out my colors and was led over to a pedicure chair, where I opted for rose petals (over lavender) in my soaking water. The chair, I felt, was a little uncomfortable. The woman doing my pedicure got to work while another woman came over to give me my gel soak-off. Or so I thought. After my gels were off, she went right into the manicure. So I had my mani and pedi going at the same time. I can see how this might be a benefit for someone who needed to get in and out, but I felt like I couldn't relax and enjoy!Right away, I noticed that the polish for my hands looked a little thick, but the mani proceeded. When my services were over, I gave at least 20 minutes of drying time before heading out. I received 5% off with the Check-In Offer, which was great as services are pricey. By the time I got back to my hotel room, I realized one of my nails already looked a little smudged. Within 48 hours, nearly all of my nails were chipped. My manicures at my usual salon typically last at least five days so to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. On the other hand, my pedicure is doing much better. Maybe I picked the wrong polish or it was an off day, but I wasn't super happy with my experience overall. Mostly because the results of my mani were so poor. Three days later, I've already removed the polish because my nails looked so bad. Bummer!",11,4,Mj3oLtE8xtrfdGLv9Q1VDA,12/2/2017,3,0,19,Beauty & Spa

I'd always wanted to try the product, yet couldn't justify spending $24 on 16 oz. of bath salts (the price has since increased to $30).  The jar was part of a gift package, but Aveda really doesn't offer discounts on its products.  However, I do appreciate that I'm able to customize gift assortments to include specific products I know the person I'm gifting is particular fond of!  [If you''re ever stumped on what to get someone for the holidays, a birthday, or any other special occasion, try your luck at any Aveda location-- all the women I know love Aveda products (some say they don't, but secretly do and just hate having to pay premium prices for them!).  You say ""But what if the person I'm gifting is a guy?""  Well, I'm going to let you in on a secret-- guys LOVE Aveda-pampering, too!  I know, bec. I've bought hair products, mint soaps, and after shaves from here, and even the most-macho guys grin from ear-to-ear when they find themselves the lucky recipients!  LOL]Anyhoo, back to that jar of soothing salts I was talking about... I've been rationing my usage of the salts for special occasions, such as when I run out of detoxifying generic Epsom salts*, or when my stash of Aura Cacia Pure Aromatherapy Foam Bath sampler pack doesn't particularly appeal to me at the time.  I am saddened to think that after tonight's wonderful bath, I only have enough for one more blissful soak :(  I know where I could get a brand-new jar for future baths, but some things in life are just more satisfying when they're gifted, don't you agree?  Hmm... Valentine's Day is just around the corner...I wish I could give this particular location 5 stars, but based on the last few visits (once or twice a year), I really can't, as the prior excellent level of customer service I'd received has considerably depreciated.  Gone are the enthusiastic, yet warm greetings, and rarely, if at all, am I greeted w/ a hot cup of licorice-mint tea, anymore.  But I still love the products, even though I almost-always now get them at Tempe's Moodswings salon...*Helpful tip:  Epsom salt baths are great after getting massages; a soak helps to significantly mitigate soreness you may sometimes experience after an intense session by reducing inflammation.  I know, bec. I used to say ""OK/alright"" when my ex-therapist would suggest a soak until I finally did one day, and wouldn't you know it, it really did help!

(I pay $50 for weekly 90 minutes with an LMT at SWIHA, who takes a cut from the service cost, and I tip an extra $20 for a great session-- yes, I invest more than $3300 annually for weekly massages, plus I treat family and friends to massages every year, as well, so I'm not miserly.  I will pay for great service with great value!)  It is strongly suggested that the LMTS are tipped 18% on a service's full price here at HES, so you will see just how much I'm saving at SWIHA**.  I finally visited for the first time a few days ago, because I received an email blast that HES was selling off their remaining Malie Organics body and home products, which HES has used for many years.  I recently arrived back from a vacation in Oahu and left with a 7.5 oz Pikake-scented body cream, which cost me $32 (orig. price).  I was happy to hear about the sales, since I would be able to stock up on more body cream (I wanted Pikake, Mango nectar, and Koke' e), as well as buy the respective $28 hand soap gels at 30% off (HES members, who pay a monthly fee, get 35% off).  Alas, there were only a few items left to purchase, most of which were home fragrances, such as diffusers and room fresheners.  For body/beauty items, there were $30 10 mL perfume oils and some body cleansers.  I left with two perfume oils in Mango Nectar and Koke'e (still a hefty $45 with the discount).  The front, with the cashier/desk and merchandise stations, felt very cramped.  I saw an office next to the cashier/desk that looked disorganized, with paperwork and cardboard boxes.  I spied a narrow corridor lined with doors that had name plaques on them.  I can only assume that the showers and other amenities that could warrant the exorbitant prices here are somewhere in the back, but I didn't get that exclusive feeling as I shopped in that cramped front room, so I don't think I would come back to try any of their services here.  Maybe the Chandler location is bigger?  I may check it out the next time an email blast notifies me of sales.Oh, and lastly, when I asked about whether there were more Malie in stock, I was told that all they had was what was out on display.  I didn't get the warm fuzzy feelings I'd get from other sales people trying to make a sale, or get you to come back, be it at touristy Oahu, or more locally here in the valley.  Just the standard welcome greeting when you walk in.  I actually felt like I was intruding, as I looked over their products.  And this after my saying that I just returned from Oahu a few days before.  No ""how was your visit,"" or any other friendly interactions.  So easy to cash in on the buzz I was still feeling from vacation.  I actually wish I could return the items I purchased, now that I'm writing this all down!Be sure to check the receipt when you sign...  I was handed a ticket for the previous customer who rang up with a discount on a $`107 service.  It might've even been to my benefit, but it wasn't the right ticket showing my fragrance purchase, so I wanted the correct one.  Why?  I don't know, since I won't be able to return themSee, another reason why I didn't enjoy my experience here.**When I first visited Oahu in 2011, I went for a massage at a spa at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which accepted Spa Finder gift certificates.  While the $200+ one-hour service, not including tip that cost me $40 for a service that is short 30 minutes of my usual, was enjoyable, it wasn't anything different as that I would get from my top favorite therapist at SWIHA at the time.  Not even the ambience, extra amenities, and the friendly conversation during the massage, of which I usually prefer silence for a more relaxing and meditative session, made up for the higher cost.",34,24,vmc3z_uscD94t0VpzYOlhw,7/20/2015,2,19,39,Beauty & Spa

Had high hopes since reading Lindsey's 5-star review.  Unfortunately, my experience here did not even deserve the one star I'm rating it!  After choosing my color and sitting down at the comfortable-looking massage chair, I saw that two women would be doing simultaneous treatments on me, and I thought ""Fantastic!  This'll be just like my experience in Charlotte, and  I'll be out of here in no time!""  The process may have taken less than an hour (I didn't keep track), and I was out of there before closing time, but that's bec. they decided to call it a day and kicked me out before my nails were dry!The retro blue chair may have looked new and comfortable, but the massage part didn't feel new- I could feel AND hear the parts move slowly in fits and starts..  Perhaps this was the reason no one bothered to turn the chair on for me- all of the nail techs at salons I regularly go to do If I forget to myself (even the one in Atlantic City that I tried for the first time did so).  I only remembered to turn it on more than halfway into the treatments, and that's bec. my back and arm were feeling fatigued due to my manicurist forcing me to lean forward on my chair (back curved) w/ my left hand painfully stretched and at a cross-angle to reach her as she sat at my right side the entire time.  (At the salon in Charlotte, the manicurist would move her chair from one side focusing on one hand, and then move to the other to work on the other hand, leaving me to recline back onto the wonderful chair to enjoy my massage w/out any inconvenience!)  I finally made it a point to take my arm away and lean my back onto the chair and let out a big sigh so she could see how strained I was, but I don't think she made the connection.  That, or she didn't give a damn!I much preferred the pedicurist as she was more personable and was conversational than the manicurist, who struck me as perhaps not as fluent in English since she didn't even bother to acknowledge my inquiry as to where she lived in the valley (pedicurist first posed the question to me; I answered, and then asked her where she lived, etc.).  I also preferred the pedicurist's work on my legs and feet over that of the manicurist's on my arms and hands, but on the whole, I've had better cleanings and paint jobs at other salons.  (The manicure I received here looked like the work of someone just learning how to paint-- the coatings were uneven and overlapped many of my cuticles.  I could've saved some money and do the work myself w/ much better results!)  What followed next, however, was definitely not cool, and will be one more reason I could never recommend this salon to anyone I know.After the treatments ended, I sat at the chair waiting for my nails to air-dry slowly in barely-cool comfort-- there weren't any UV-light machines to help set the coats.  There weren't even any of those mini-fans to help the nails dry.  The tropical feel of the place (Asian decor-- ceiling fans w/ blades that look like hand fans; wooden panel screens w/ Japanese flora and fauna depictions; bamboo trees here and there) and the sleepy rhythm of the overhead fans made me reminisce back to childhood days in Manila, specifically to siesta time, when all you could hear is the whirring noises of the fan's blades and head as it rotated from side to side, and I was actually beginning to feel warm and fuzzy.  I was lulled back to the present when everyone seemed to be gathering their clothes and bags and lowering blinds down.  I commented that it must be time to go home as I looked at my watch (5:30p) and asked, ""but don't you close at 6?"".  A third woman chuckled and said yes, but business was very slow, so they were going to close early.  I've visited other salons when it was near closing time, but I never once was kicked out.  I've even stayed past closing and watched them clean up shop, bec. they cared enough about the quality of their work to make sure that I left w/ dry nails.  The women at  Queen's Nails would not show me this courtesy, and I find that completely disgraceful.  My suggestion is to skip this salon and go somewhere else where your body AND your money will be treated w/ more respect!",14,5,0Qn9w2rUHS9OHouR_GLS8g,10/31/2010,1,5,38,Beauty & Spa

Called soon after our talk and tried to make an appointment, but Denise's calendar was almost booked solid through the new year.

I had some free time today and called to see if she could see me.Denise asked me a few questions to see what I was looking to resolve in this visit, and then offered to let me change into a smock when I quickly begged off to look for a shirt in my car to change into, since I was feeling too warm in my light sweater in her warm salon.  (She remarked that it was supposed to reach a high of 81 today.)   Ahh, much better.  Still, I found it too warm for comfort during the 55 minutes I was there.  I'll make sure to plan more carefully on my next visits.I have to admit, I wasn't fawning over my haircut as Denise was doing her finishing touches, but after raking my fingers once or twice, I thought my hairstyle looked fabulous!  Mom immediately loved it, as well, and as some of you may know from reading my reviews of other salons, she is a hard woman to impress!I didn't know that Denise/Urge Salon did not accept credit cards as forms of payment- CASH OR CHECK ONLY.  Strange, I thought, not to accept CCs... I've heard of many small- to mid-sized businesses turning down Amex, because of the fee Amex charges per transaction, but Visa always works, but not here.  Thought I'd give you fair warning.  I had just pared down the cash I'd been carrying, because I don't feel secure walking around with it, but I did have enough to cover what she charges for a woman's cut and style ($55), minus the 20% discount if you, according to Urge's website (and on the Yelp app), ""call and book an appointment today.""  There's a nice check-in offer of 30% off on your second visit, as well...  Denise was friendly and easy to chat with.  I wasn't a fan of sitting on the ""booster chair,"" even though I offered to sit on it after she mentioned its availability.  (Truth be told, I was expecting a thick chair pad, or two, and not one of those foot stools one keeps in the kitchen to access hard-to-reach shelves, but oh, well...)  I really liked the specialty chairs she has at the washing stations, though!  As you sit down and lean back, you bend your knees and place your feet at the end of the chair pad so that the chair reclines in such as way that your neck sits comfortably on the sink- pretty cool!  No more of my neck feeling stiff while getting my hair washed- yay!

I am pleased to report that while staff members are quick to welcome guests and offer assistance, they know to leave you alone if you ""just want to look.""  The reps I'd met yesterday and on the first visit knew much about their products, and even if they didn't, I had the feeling they'd go to great lengths to find out.  I can't say the same about my second visit, unfortunately, but it was late in the day, fifteen minutes to closing time as a matter of fact, so I didn't mind, since I knew that all of the info I sought was online.  On the other hand, if I wasn't lucky to have internet access and/or reside nearby, I don't know if I'd have cared to return again had I not purchased a Groupon, especially after noting that the rep wasn't inspired enough to look for the info either from printed or online databases, irregardless of the time of day.  I found Ashley to be very helpful during today's visit.I really like that MOST of the products sold here are parabens-free and MOST of the cleansing products are sulfates-free.  I find that I am not able to sample many of the products offered here due to food allergies**, but it's refreshing to find more and more businesses that strive to offer products using natural ingredients- sometimes even organic!  Not only does Lather strive to help people who are looking for natural alternatives in facial, body, hair, and aromatherapy products, but it also gives back to the environment (by packaging their products in containers made from recycled materials, by offering 10% off purchases to customers returning Lather recyclables, and by purchasing carbon off-sets) and to charities by partnering with and contributing to the following three organizations: Carbonfund.org, Cleantheworld.org, and Headaches.org.  To find out more about Lather's mission, history, and the products offered (and their ingredients), check out www.lather.com.  BTW, do you know that Lather only has three locations in the U.S. (CA, GA, and AZ), and that its products can be found in upscale hotels, such as Las Vegas' Borgata and Wynn, and Canyon Ranch?  Granted, I've never been to any of these hotels, but I know of their reputation, so I'm impressed to hear and read that these hotels endorse Lather products.I like the slatted wood soap dish I found here, as it prevents water puddles from forming, thereby extending the life of my exfoliating lavender soap.  If you use delicate glycerine- and olive oil-based soaps, you may find this dish a nice investment, as well.  I hope to update my review in a few months' time (maybe sooner) to write about my experiences with the products I'd bought today, specifically the Vitamin C Peptide Renewal and the Shine Control Face Lotion.**I realized many years ago that those skin rashes and breakouts I'd get from time-to-time were allergic reactions to specific natural ingredients, such as carrot, avocado, corn, rice, and any orange variety, be it orange, bergamot, tangerine, neroli, and so on, to name a few.  (I'm still experimenting with sweet almond oil... I'm thinking it's more of an intolerance, since I am able to tolerate hand and body products, but not facial.  Now that I know which ingredients to avoid, I rarely experience breakouts and rashes.  If only I could stay away from them when I dine out!",7,7,Gu77gOjAIRd0Q3eyKmvRVg,9/13/2013,4,2,36,Beauty & Spa

I told the man at the desk that we had other plans for the day and needed two mani/pedis right away before lunch, so he suggested we try out McDowell Mountain Nails on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd.  I've never been, but I knew the location, so I told my sister ""why don't we try it?""Situated at the Target plaza, between a Jamba Juice and a Ross on FLW east of the 101, MMN was easy to find.  It looked very unassuming from the outside, certainly much smaller than Scottsdale Nails II and my ex-favorite Shea Nails on 92nd St. (please read my reviews).  It was small indoors, but clean, and most importantly, lacked the horribly strong stench of chemicals that greeted us at Scottsdale Nails a few minutes before.  We were greeted by a young Caucasian male who was standing next to a female Asian, who was speaking on the phone.  A little different, since we're used to frequenting salons entirely staffed by Asians...  I asked if the two of us would be able to have our mani/pedis worked on right away, as well as my niece and her manicure, and he assured us most definitely.  The woman had by then gotten off the phone (thank goodness, as she was speaking directly to our faces while on the phone, instead of moving off to the side to give herself and us more privacy).  He told her what we were looking for, and she proceeded to tell him who to pair us up with.  I heard that I was going to get ""the new girl,"" which then made me think, ""why me?""  ""Why do I get to try the new girl?""  I wasn't worried, however, as I had a feeling everything would work out fine.  After choosing our polish materials, we all went our separate ways.The ""new girl"" Ann, was a joy to be with!  While she is new to this company, she told me she's been a nail tech for many years.  She had just finished a couple hours of orientation (she learned what the packages/treatments were called, and what steps she had to fulfill, etc.) that morning, and I was her first customer!  She worked gently, and listened to me tell her how we came to try out this salon, and would ask a couple of times if she was causing any discomfort.  Very easy to converse with- in case some of you are not able to understand staff with heavy accents, Ann speaks fluent English (and is studying Biochemistry... we're common souls!), so if this is important to you, ask for Ann.  :)We finished slightly after my sister and her daughter.  My sister was seated for her spa pedicure before her manicure, while Ann started on my manicure first.  My niece was originally going to get just a manicure, but when I saw the embellishments that Linda had added to the nails, I asked how much it would be for a pedicure polish.  I was told $5 for just color, and $10 for the matching white polka dots and silver points.  I said let's get it done!$55 for my gel manicure and spa pedicure, $25 for my niece's manicure (cleaning and polish) and pedicure (polish only), plus slightly over 20% tip*.  My sister got acrylic nails on her hands and a spa pedicure, as well.  We all left very happy and very satisfied with our new looks!  (Niece absolutely ENJOYED her first visit to the nail salon and cannot wait till their return here next year for another one!)  Thank you, McDowell Mountain Nails...

The first bath bomb I tried was called Geo Phyzz (Hawaiian seasalt, sandalwood, cypress, and pine), but I wasn't too impressed with the small bath globe.  My apartment's bathroom features a Roman tub, which allows for a deeper bath, but I rarely fill it past the tops of my quads.  (TMI?  Sorry!)  Anyhoo, the Geo Phyzz didn't alter the bathwater much, as far as I could tell.  Not much scent, color, or even fizzing!  My muscles didn't feel refreshed immediately-after, nor the next day.  Perhaps due to its smaller size, I need to use two bath bombs, but Lush's bath bombs aren't inexpensive.  Heck!  Nothing at Lush runs cheap!  Just as the store's name implies, Lush is all about pure bath and beauty indulgence!  I think the Geo Phyzz cost just under $5, which I thought was a complete waste of money and not worth a second chance.  (Not from me, anyway.)The second time I went, I chose the Big Blue, which was considerably bigger than the Geo Phyzz and consisted of sodium bicarbonate, two varieties of seaweed, including Arame, both fine and course sea salts, lemon, and lavender oils, and other ingredients** (cleansing and coloring components).  It cost just under $7 and was definitely a winner!  Loved the tropical fragrances that scented the bathwater, my skin, AND the bathroom!  My muscles thanked me for the indulgence, and I believe I even slept in a little longer, too!  :)  Have yet to try the Twilight Ballistic ($6.25; lavender, tonka absolute, ylang-ylang), which I purchased the same day as the Geo Phyzz.  It smells HEAVENLY and, for me, a touch of sweetness.  Mmm... I can't wait!  ;)**Very much appreciate how the products come with ingredients' lists on their shelves.

Later, while chatting w/ my hair stylist Jeff Brown, I found out that the chefs here used to work at now defunct Fine's Cellars!

I asked a coworker who did body painting and received a quote from her, but there was a question of whether the products she used would be safe for me to try, so I put the thought away.  The next day, I remembered that mall department stores offered makeovers all the time, and then I thought of Sephora's makeover stations that I never tried.  What a perfect time to do so, I thought, so I made the call.  The woman on the phone asked if I had photos of the look I wanted, and I said I'd bring some, and I asked for a time estimate.  She said an hour.  I made an appointment for 4:30p, but as it turned out, I arrived early and was introduced to Amber, who was to be my custom makeup artist.  Amber was very amiable, conversational, and excited to do something out-of-the-ordinary, which made the whole process of getting a makeover very fun!  I have sensitive skin, as well as food and environmental allergies that keep me from using foundation and many products, so I was nervous about the possibility of negative reactions to any of the products we were going to try, but the only problem I encountered was a mild itch on my nose- not enough for me to want to run to the nearest sink and wash off all the products!  The whole process took about two hours**, and Amber answered all of my questions throughout.  I received many compliments at the Dia de los muertos party I attended, despite the fact that attendees could receive COMPLIMENTARY makeup from an artist present at the party.  (I was even approached by a mother with a young girl at the end of the event who wanted photographs taken with me!)  At least I knew that I was using quality products designed for surgical patients through Amber and Sephora!  (Not to say that the artist there wasn't using quality products, but with party time constraints, I wouldn't have been able to ask her all I needed to know to avoid skin reactions.  All that had their makeup done with her looked terrific!)I would like to schedule more makeovers at Sephora so that I may learn how to achieve certain looks, as well as try out new products, and I will ask for Amber again, or someone she recommends I try.*Please note that there is a $50 minimum purchase associated with a custom makeover.**Amber went above and beyond her duties as a Sephora makeup artist when she assisted in applying tattoo decals I had purchased elsewhere, as well as allowed me to pay for products there at the CM station, rather than have me wait to pay at the cashier.

The second time was when reparations at SWIHA caused them to close shop and move all appointments (including my massage) here.  I was not able to enjoy the massage as much, bec. the open ceilings allowed all sorts of noises (conversations, construction noises coming from next door, etc.) in- too distracting.I was able to experience my first mud wrap after first reading about SWINA's offering back in June '08 last Friday.  I'd have to say it was nothing I thought it would be.  I thought I'd be lying in a bed of mud (like I've seen in European travel logs) w/ some slices of fruit or veggies covering my eyes (no, not cucumber slices... I'm allergic to cukes!).  Nope.  No mud bed.  No sliced garnishes placed on the windows of my soul.  However, I did get two women to simultaneously massage my back (Cassie) and leg muscles (Patty)!!  Woah!  So this is what tandem massages are all about!!  I asked if this was standard practice here in SWINA, 'cause if it is, I could definitely get used to this!  But no, I'm told that I got lucky that day, w/ students' schedules opening up at just the right moment to allow me this extra luxury.  (If you ask me, I think it's a ploy to get newbies to come back for treatments week after week!)But let's backtrack a bit and start in the beginning.  After stripping down to my comfort level (topless), and lying face down on the massage table (I requested a face pillow for more comfort), Cassie and Patty proceeded to give me the back and leg massages.  Afterwards, they employed natural brushes over exposed areas for an all-over exfoliation.  The sensations ranged from slightly ticklish to soothing (you may tailor the pressure exerted).  I was asked to flip over onto my back, and soon after, the mud was then painted on by both women with another set of brushes.  This was when the treatment started to go downhill for me... the mud was applied cold, and thank goodness there was a heat lamp nearby to keep me warm.  After painting my back, arms, legs, and abs, the two women proceeded to wrap plastic around my extremities and then again w/ another wrap that was already laid on top of the massage table under me.  (If you suffer from claustrophobia, body wraps are not for you!)  Patty then left Cassie to help another student.  Cassie then proceeded to give me my second favorite part of the treatment, which is a head and neck massage.  Nice!!  After, Cassie offered to give me something complimentary- a facial massage!  Would I want one?  Why, yes, thank you very much!  After all that pampering, we were now at the point where I again had to endure chills while Cassie wiped off the mud w/ warm towels.  But I requested hotter towels, as in steaming hot!, and poor Cassie... her hands were burning!, but she did what I requested, and I was able to stave off the chills for awhile.  To ""wrap"" things up, Cassie followed up w/ a hypoallergenic Lotus Touch lotion.  My skin felt supple, but nothing different than what I'd experience after a bath at home using Aveda Soothing Therapy salts.  On the whole, the experience was good, but most of it is bec. of Cassie's bedside manner.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask for her again.  However, I don't think I'd try another wrap- SWINA offers three: mud, seaweed, and herbal- since I'd rather not get chilled, plus the plastic wraps used aren't biodegradeable, so I'd feel guilty causing all that pollution!  I'd say that the tandem, head, neck, and facial massages were my favorite parts, and for that, I'll just stick w/ SWIHA.  I will be back to try other services (hour-long facials for $30, anyone?).",8,5,wJdRSZc0vZeE8D_V-5Zdyg,1/19/2009,3,4,25,Beauty & Spa

I went on a Monday and there was only one lady there when I arrived; and a few ladies in the locker room area as I departed. The other main reason is you pay less Monday-Thursday. I studied the service menu extensively before I booked my room at the Hotel and to see what treatments I wanted. I ultimately chose the time ritual where you are paying for a block of time. I decided to go really big and get the 2 hour/50 minutes.You check in and they wash your feet and trade your shoes for cute plastic sandals. Then you get ushered into the locker room and are shown around. The waiting area has these chaise lounge things with a view of the southern part of Las Vegas Boulevard. Eventually your person comes to collect you.I knew for sure I wanted a facial but beyond that I wasn't really sure. More feet washing. Jonsey said there was time to do a number of things so we started with a facial, then did a scrub, wrap and ended with a massage and finished the facial. Each treatment room has it's own tub and shower and you are ushered in and out between treatments. I felt a little too warm when I was wrapped up like a baked potato but other than that everything was top notch.It is pricey even at the reduced cost Mon-Thurs but you get your moneys worth and then some. I also appreciate that there was no big push on the products whatsoever rather than their presence in the Spa Boutique.The robes were also insanely comfy I really want one.

The major downside of dry shampoo is that it's not conducive to flying:  dry shampoo is an aerosol powder, and pressure changes associated with flying in an airplane ruin the product the majority of the time.  Thus, if I'm flying somewhere and staying for more than a couple days I hunt down a place to buy Big Sexy Hair Dry Shampoo.  Enter Ulta.Stopped by this Ulta location while in town a couple weeks ago to score some dry shampoo.  Was interested in a travel size version of the stuff, but an Ulta employee informed me that the only small cans of dry shampoo in the store were Oscar Blandi brand.  Alright, I'm down to try new things.  The employee explained that the Oscar Blandi product specifically for brunettes is great because it doesn't create the fine white film associated with most dry shampoo brands (true) and adds serious volume (not true at all).  I paid $11 for the little can of Oscar Blandi product but in hindsight would gladly have paid $16.95 for the full-size Sexy Hair dry shampoo that I love so dearly.

Her choice of CC Salon & Spa--though neither she nor I had been there before Friday--was a good one.My first pedicure ever, by the way.I'm in love with the results of my pedicure and the nude-colored OPI polish (""Tickle My France-y"" or some similar silly name) I chose.  During portions of my life I've been a gymnast, dancer, runner, weightlifter, and hiker.  In other words, my toes/feet/nails have pretty much always taken a beating and have never looked nearly as good as they do now.  The pedicure my friend and I received included exfoliation and massaging, but the focus was definitely on the toenails and cuticles.  Every aspect of our pedicure was relaxing and produced nice results.  Jenn did our pedicures.  She was great and seamlessly switched back and forth between me and my friend while my friend and I sat side by side.  We were in the comfortable pedicure chairs for nearly 2 hours, so my guess is that the standard Pedicure at CC Salon & Spa lasts between 45 and 60 minutes.  (Also available are the Express Pedicure for $35 and the Spa Pedicure for $55.)  The pre-gratuity price of the standard Pedicure is $45 and increases to about $50 after tax is figured in.Sanitation seemed in line with what is required at such an establishment.  The used soaking water was drained in our presence, and I also witnessed the sanitization of the various metal tools that had been in contact with our feet.CC Salon & Spa is located within a business complex of tidy little buildings that resemble houses.

I have to admit that when I pulled into the complex (Acqua Blu Med Spa + Premier Plastic Surgery & Dermatology) for the first time I was speechless when I saw that, well, this building is hardly the nicest or newest in the area.  And the gray-as-gray-can-be sky didn't help.In December I treated myself to a photofacial to remove or at least minimize some small capillaries on my nose and some light sun spots on my cheeks.  I'd been interested in a photofacial for years, so when the procedure only took about 15 minutes--application of gel, 2 passes of the laser (once to treat red areas, once to treat brown spots), and application of moisturizer with SPF--I was disappointed.  Turns out I didn't really need a photofacial after all.  My results were basically non-existent; perhaps those with more significantly damaged skin would benefit from this procedure.  Most of all and as stated previously, I was disappointed in how short the treatment lasted.  It would have been nice to work in a facial massage, masque, or something similar to increase the bang-for-buck.  Had I paid full price I'd have felt taken advantage of.My microdermabrasion in February, on the other hand, was really nice--a great boost for my winter blah skin.  I thought the process was gentle, and I experienced no discomfort or redness or irritation at all.  My skin was softer, clearer, and looked brighter and refreshed for several weeks following the microderm.Definitely wouldn't recommend spending full price at Acqua Blu.

Why? Having too many options gives me anxiety. The thought of a huge, self-serve makeup and beauty shop honestly sounds like hell on wheels to me. It already takes me longer than your average human to make a decision, but wandering around a place like Ulta or Sephora--walls lined with shades of make-up only slightly different than the ones around it, eyes glazed over... no thank you. I grew up visiting beauty counters at the department stores with my Mom. She'd always take me along with her and let me get my makeup done at Clinique or Chanel. But these days I wouldn't dream about buying anything other than eye shadows and longer-lasting makeup items from those places. It's just too expensive. But I still crave that 1-on-1 service of a professional who knows his/her craft and can help me help myself. Because even if you're buying cheaper makeup, you can waste your time and money on the wrong purchases. You're still not going to get that 1:1 experience with the expertise I'm talking about at stores like Ulta, but at this particular location I got great service. I was asked if I needed help and she even checked the back for me! She also got me involved in the rewards program. I loved that I didn't have to drive out of my way to come here or go inside a mall like I've had to with Sephora. I also appreciated their vast selection of NYX products that are super-reasonably priced. Like I said, I don't mind investing in some lasting products from more expensive stores, but for my everyday makeup, Chanel and likewise really isn't in my budget. NYX is also great for trendy colors you know you won't be sporting past this season. One thing I really don't like about huge makeup places like this quality control. Because Ulta is so huge with so many nooks and crannies, I found myself unable to buy over 6 items I wanted because they had been opened already. They checked the back, too. But someone felt the need to open the last of 6 different kinds of products to try them. I'm not talking about testers here... I'm talking about people who just open anything they want to try and then put it back, without any regard for others. With a store this big, Ulta suffers from this problem A LOT. And it's gross. I think if they were better staffed and made an effort to be sure testers were readily available, this wouldn't happen as much. The last time I was there hoards of teenage girls were running around opening products and no one said a word. Lastly, like a few other Yelpers have eluded to, the inventory at Ulta is so vast that there's no way every staff member can be an expert at all the lines of products. While some Yelpers find this OK, I only find this acceptable if I'm coming for makeup I've already tried. This is why I do NOT come to Ulta to discover new products, but only to pick up what I know I love.",5,1,OlvQpnWiAUNP98AVOGQqzg,4/6/2015,3,2,49,Beauty & Spa

I've only witnessed his expertise with mens and boys cuts, but watching his work makes me think he's great with the ladies styles, too. The little guy has really, really thick, straight hair. It can get really heavy on him, floppy and almost a little anime-ish. He's never liked getting his hair cut and went through a phase where he just wanted it long and in his eyes.

Period. My sister, although ultimately happy with the result, had her nails redone about 4 times. The girl who was helping her did everything she could to make sure that when my sister left, her gel mani was right, but still... poor form. 2) When I came in I told them the design I wanted on my nails, they told me they could do it. They couldn't. In fact, they have one girl there who can do nail art the way it's supposed to be done. That's it. And she wasn't there. My gal ( I will not share her name because I don't want her connected to a so-so review. She's great!) just couldn't get the help and support she needed. She could do some nail art, but there was NO ONE there to help her with what she couldn't do. She tried two different methods to get my nails done and just couldn't get it. I felt awful for her--but I also was getting really upset. By the time we left we had been there about 3.5 hours. That's WAY tooo long. I had things to do and I had not planned on more than 1.5hrs, which is more than enough for your standard pedi and gel mani. 3) I also watched them turning away multiple walk-in clients when their signage outside clearly stated ""walk-ins welcome."" That could seem like a positive to some, but to me I saw two customers leaving with a horrible taste in their mouths... it was visible on their faces. If I were the business owner, I WOULD NEVER want any employee of mine to treat a potential customer that way. There are so many ways to remedy that situation. But if I were a business owner, I'd offer any walk-in client who couldn't be served anytime that day a discount on their next service. But that's just me. Now on to the positives, which there are plenty. The space itself is large and very clean. Each pedicure station looked freshly cleaned--all with signage assuring you so. Their gel nail color selection is one of the best and most updated I've seen around. You'll have a hard time choosing most certainly. They have a simple and moderately priced pedicure, but be careful what you say ""yes"" to as it will add extra charges. They have varying scented lotions you can pick from for your pedicures and the pedi's themselves look great.

Without skimping on service, the gentleman helping me got me through a great pedicure without delay. In fact, the longest part of the whole process was picking out the damn nail color. Then my first gel manicure was a great experience! It went quickly and has lasted well over a week at this point. He did it perfectly and I can't wait to come back to get my next manicure. One thing I think that could be improved on is the color selection. It's not that they don't have a lot of colors, but normally when I've gone to nail salons they have displays out with new, relevant and seasonal color lines. This is helpful to those of  us who don't get our nails done often and are really indecisive. I think I'll just come in better prepared next time. The price was around what I remember when I used to get my nails done more often. I think next time I""ll just get my toe nails painted (not a full pedi) when I get my gel manicure. And hopefully the service always stays this good!",2,0,v4JDK_HrSNtVC464O5_jpA,8/6/2014,4,0,18,Beauty & Spa

It is a clean, friendly and chic atmosphere. There's a bit of confusion as to what door is the entrance, and they seem utterly confused and not set up for people taking the stairs up instead of the elevator. Some signage in the stairwells would help.I went to two stylists here - Sharon and LaVerne. Both seemed quite competent, but my frustrations primarily come with timeliness of this place. I think I came here 3 or 4 times. None of the times did my appointment start within 15 minutes of when it was supposed to. With Sharon, I was always double-booked while she was doing a coloring of another client's hair, so I usually ended up with an assistant washing my hair, waiting, and then getting my hair cut while the other client was waiting for color to set, and they continued their conversation. It is kind of awkward, and feels like you're not getting 100% attention from the stylist.Sharon is extremely meticulous in her work, making sure there is not a stray hair out of place, following the grain of my hair, and taking great care to make everything even. If I were getting married or going to appear on TV, I'd probably want this level of care. But, when it's a random Tuesday and I'm trying to meet up for dinner with friends, or make it back to work without spending 2 hours at the salon - it is a bit overkill.One time when I was in dire need of a cut, and Sharon wasn't available, I went to LaVerne. LaVerne did a good job, but my cut didn't quite turn out how I wanted - and was quite a bit shorter than I was going for. I'd try going to her again, though.I'm not completely against this place because there's a lot to like, but I'm not totally in love with it, either, as I've had better. It is above average for Pittsburgh, and if I'd definitely recommend it over some other places for somebody looking for a cut.

Relaxing? Maybe.. for... parts of it. Effective? Deep tissue? Absolutely.Mary figured out exactly what was wrong with my back without me even telling her that my shoulders/back hurt. She could just tell from feeling it. The combination of ashiatsu, deep tissue, Swedish, Thai, hot stone, and Chinese massages was wonderful. I left feeling aligned, loosened, and overall just great. She put a ton of work and muscle into kneading the knots out of my back, legs, etc. Prices are very reasonable. 60 minutes was $60 at the time of this writing. And, it was *actually* 60 full minutes, not like a 50-minute hour. Most places are far more expensive or require some shady contract.There were a few downsides, but none enough to lose a star for me:1) Its cash-only. They didn't warn me, so I had to go get some cash from an ATM afterwards.2) The table was a bit short for me. But, I'm a pretty tall guy. The face cutout was also a little tiny for my head - squishing my nose a bit. I'd prefer a different table.3) As others mentioned, there is a bit of a different attitude towards modesty. I opted to completely disrobe, as I've found most therapists can do a much better job on the glutes (and after doing squats, lunges, deadlifts, rowing, skiing, biking, running, etc I need them to do a good job) with no clothing in the way. Ultimately, I was glad I made that decision, as she was indeed able to massage the hell out of my butt muscles and lower back without obstruction. I was covered in a towel which was displaced as necessary, but it most certainly wasn't always covering all the manbits at all times. Oh well. At the end of the day, I completely didn't care, though, because she was absolutely professional about it and I was in such a state of zen muscular submission that the towel wasn't even necessary. I could see this may bother others, though, so keep that in mind.4) I called ahead to make an appointment, but I don't think they actually took my name.

She was great and I immediately thought that this experience was going to be MUCH better than Pigtais and Crewcuts or wherever we've taken my daughter before.  She said my daughter down in the chair and asked what we were doing with her hair.  She then took her over to the wash station and shampooed and conditioned her hair.  Then she took about 30 minutes to give her the best cut that she's ever had.  She layered, cut, trimmed and roller brushed her heart out.  She conversed with my daughter the whole time and made her feel special.  When we were done everyone was happy.  Like I said, I don't do salons for obvious reasons.

The owner completed my facial and she was nice enough.  The place and Decor is very aesthetically pleasing.  Water is offered in a wine glass and the robes are provided as you go between the rooms; however, the owner could stand to replace the sheets. As the sheets on the table for the facial room or estheticians room wasn't dirty but you could tell they had been stained.Anywho, I had every intention on giving five stars after getting my massage but that facial left a lot to be desired she was throwing her extractions but literally I think the group hunt yeah the group was $100 then another 40 to upgrade the face show I feel like it was a Hustle and with that being said I've had better facials I mean kneaded relief is great. Nonetheless; I will give kudos for the extractions on my face so that was done very well. I had to hold my mask longer than the five minutes I was initially told (she left me for 15m) this would not have been a big deal had I not needed to make a trip to Rock Hill and return to work.All in all the prices have increased because there's a manual change on the menu but I will return for services from Candace as again...I  applaud her effort, her pressure, her professionalism and her bedside manner.

That being said, let me explain what I like: The clean place. It's not jam-packed full of things and nice appointed. It's in a shared building space and it works. The signage tells you she's in Suite #8, complete the forms at the desk (I missed this because my appt was for 5pm and I thought I should just walk straight back), she asked me to return and complete a form then I read the instructions to take a seat. What I don't like: I was rescheduled, texted and was told I'm a priority so do just that - when I arrive... I don't expect to see anyone getting serviced - just you waiting on me. Nope~ I had to wait. I must be getting old or enough Judges have drilled on about punctuality that I don't care for the tardiness - not from me or anyone else. It just says my time is more valuable than the person you have waiting for you. Moving along.... I thought about leaving and just getting a refund. Glad I stayed because we talked. She acknowledged it and learned about my nail preferences, just clear please and keep my length. No need to even each nail length just square them off. She has a lot of color options and I've been to enough nail places to last me. She's educated about her profession and willing to teach you whatever she can to help you achieve what you want. I'm not interested in the latest looks; I simply want healthy nails and want to avoid breakage as much as possible. Not too talkative - this I like. Considerate enough. Working hard to establish a loyal clientele. Didn't speak ill of any other places that I named or explained my experiences. She's overly booked due to a GroupOn deal and looking for help. Across from the westside Raddisson Hotel. Uses an online booking service via GroupOn. Takes cards but I will bring cash next time to cut down on service fees. I'm conscientious of such when it's a small business and she's trying to grow her business. Has full massage chairs for the pedicures. Two in place. WIll host ladies nights or have a group event. In acknowledging me as being a priority - I didn't want any freebie upgrades, I just want my appointment to start and end on time. She received this well and the proof will come at the next appointment so we'll see. Drawback: She didn't massage the lotion in my hands once she squirted this on. Now, maybe I'm wrong but everyone else does this especially the Asian-owned salons but hey~ I know next time to watch and see if she'll complete it with others. Maybe Kim D. was the patron getting serviced when I called a few months back to schedule but that's what happens when you're small and new - you dont' have enough folks around to do everything. She offers a loyalty program - prepay and get 2 shellac mani's for $30. Book before you leave or book at your next appointment.

Only if someone else was paying and my regular spot was closed for good. Hence 2.5 plus the average of 3+2/2=2.5 (call me for a mean)Here's the deal: Went on Friday for a Bridal Party extravaganza. The bride wanted us to have the same color polish and this would be our treat. I could've went without. They opened at 9am. I think they normally open at 9:30am. She's all in love with these folks and has been going here for years - I think it was because she lived directly across the street like most grad students and went out of convenience. I know she's a tipper because she does hair on the side so she believes in big tips coming back to her.

She preps for the pedi station. It appears clean and the place is brightly lit - I will admit I was shocked it was in disarray or disrepair like a nail shop I used to patronize on the westside. I get the last pedastal. Young thin girl comes in with her body hugging dress and it's short. She preps, I'm put in the water and it's luke -tepid at best. I like it to be warm - not scalding hot but warm. I make do. The massager controls are super glued to the arm of the chair. It's somewhat broken down so they have to prop it for me. When the other 4-5 folks start getting pedi's I noticed that my girl didn't ""bang my legs"" like the older women were doing. Cute young boy came back to town and he was being made fun of by an older woman (it was for our benefit to laugh and we did). Back to my pedi: she did the most basic job and polished my toes. One side of their drying station doesn't work. I tipped and that was that. If you can go to the shorter middle age woman or the average height but taller lady with long black hair (she wore two French braids and the hair length was in the middle of her back) as they seem to be attentive and detailed. I didn't have to deal with the ""hood"" matters such as the previous Yelper wrote. BUT there was a note taped to the drying station that you will be asked to leave if (1) you talk to loud, (2) disturb others, (3) try to fight. And there's another sign that says no children unless they are being serviced. I was shocked how many folks stopped in at 9:30am trying to get work done. She had to turn away everyone until noon. Sidebar: POSITIVE ON EVERYONE SPEAKING ENGLISH IN FRONT OF US. 1 TV & it's angled that you'll never see it while in the pedicure pedastals. but there's a sofa for folks to wait in front of the pedi station along with 2 folding chairs.",0,0,1p3_wBFc_wDyQNjARgeJyQ,9/19/2012,3,1,27,Beauty & Spa

Buy the packages, get the monthly deals offered and always and I MEAN ALWAYS BUYYY THE Gift certificate offerings. 2nd, I always bought the gift certificates to gift to professors and classroom teachers and used the 1/12 to ensure I saw them monthly. Otherwise, I wouldn't have made such diligent efforts to self-care. 3rd, I like Nicole & Duke for their vision and hiring good people while actually being honorable. How so? Yo!! I started with them on S. Park and it wasn't the ohhh lalala place yet the service was beyond reproach. 4th, They find some of the best and most attentive therapists. I never got a manicure in the new Fitchburg place but I definitely found my trademark OPI Chicago Toast color via them while on S. Park and 5th, they listen to their clientele. I haven't made it back while in town but I hated those benches for pedicures. Looked online to book my upcoming appointment and they've got the individual massage thrones for pedicures. Now I can't wait to experience it all. 6th, The locker room and robe and process and waiting room helps EVEN ME unwind and prepare to receive ""kneaded relief"" no pun intended but yoooo. I don't meditate and ""clear my mind"" but I practice yoga and can say - I'm just designed to run in auto pilot yet the therapy room even works for after the massage and facial. MOST IMPORTANTLY: I am and have been judging and measuring places based on this location and all my experiences with the company since 2004. I must admit: Sundara in the Dells don't compare (it's like judging pineapples to apples - sounds the same but Sundara can work for overnight and when there's a snowfall + for coupling but Kneaded Relief wins for everything). I am comfortable bringing the kid here. Bioelements work but I would rather have CellexC. I did stop uying the products once I switched over to CellexC but I still came here for application even though the guys on Odana, RZ, use CellexC but they don't have the touch KRDS provides and I've come to expect. Inbox for more details but Nicole & Duke stand with their team members if they have family issues, some have endured and survived cancer treatments, give back to the community and all the while bringing up their own family. Look! I respect that. Oh! and I would recommend Duke for working out (EXERCISE) although I didn't choose him - it was simply a matter of convenience and I'm the only everything in my family so it just couldn't work.

That's were the fun stopsWent in with a sorority sister and couldn't justify sitting and watching her get a pedi to pass the time. So I saw $26 and thought ok. Checked for tools and cleanliness and felt ok~ I'll give them a shot. Why she goes here? I forgot but she won't again. So she says!The good:1) They were busy so we soaked for some time as requested2) They have wi-fi. They pay the Library to teether and it works well3)THEY HAVE LITTLE KID MASSAGE CHAIRS & ALL. SOOOOO CUTE.IT'S ADORABLE.  4) THAI APPEARED TO BE KNOWLEDABLE AND HE'S A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER. 5) NICE COLOR SELECTION. UP TO DATE ON NEW TECHNIQUES6) APPARENTLY THEY WAX AND EVERYTHING ELSE. What could improve: 1) Upfront pricing. I had on my Shellac Pedicure from VDazzle and he charged an extra $5 for removal. Really? He didn't tell me this when he started solely when we finished. 1b- To remove the polish all he did was use the tool (name aludes me now) and a bunch of acetone. I don't think this is healthy for my nail bed but whatever.2) No pedi parafin like ENVY Nails. The more I write the more I'm reliving my experience and thinking a 2 star should be here but I'll proceed. 3) The mani turned to Shellac so of course the price goes up and I ask how much...4) Agree to the shellac mani but how about this. More drilling then soaking in ACETONE to get rid of the Shellac. Now this is my 1st Shellac removal. Maybe everyone is doing this. If they are - I'm no longer getting shellac. I normally only wear clear on my nails because I don't like when the polish doesn't last but Shellac appeared to be the remedy. 5) I got a clear Shellac. Sounds nice in theory & it is glossy BUT it just won't work for me. The obvious issue: dirty nails under the tips on my bed. So I'm always pickingto  make sure they are clean. 6) He cut down my nails without asking. He tried this during the pedi but I caught him. This time I didn't. So my right hand is shorter. I prefer to be asked what length do you want. My nails are long & I prefer them to be that way. I don't care about wearing my nails short but people pay for length - WHY WOULD YOU THINK I WANT THEM SHORT WHEN WOMEN DO PAY FOR LONG FAKE NAILS?? When I asked, he said - because one was shorter so he was making them all the same length. I'm like - nope! that one will just have to be short. These are my human nails I could care less about an even appearance. Anywhoo, I'm not upset about it that I'd argue or something...this is simply my typing or touchscreen hand now. Moving on. What should have been a $38 experience based on the posted price ($26 Spa Pedi or $38 Spa Pedi/Mani) turned into a $56 ordeal before tip. WTh!Here's the itemization:$26 spa pedi$5 pedi removalthe remainder for your mani. I asked well aren't you going to cut my cuticles around my fingernail bed? He said that will be extra. THAT COMMENT WILL NOW MAKE THIS A 2 STAR REVIEW. Any guy off the street nows a manicure is a manicure. That entails clipping away old skin around the nail bed and pushing back the cuticle. Yeah~ 2 stars is all that is needed. No 2.5, especially not a 3. I'll update this if my regular place does the same because maybe this is the industry standard and I'm simply unlearned in this matter.",6,0,iXBM2W8gaq9ItfKAAIQlew,8/20/2012,2,4,27,Beauty & Spa

Our student, Cleveland, will be the stand out star in this review. The floor under the receptionist booth is dirty. See pictures. The issue I have is a simple rod set as booked on the phone, reiterated at confirmation and consult could not be performed as it would ""take too long."" Now all this was said outside of my presence but today it wasn't a matter of taking too long but a matter of it couldn't be performed as the service requested, A roller set, wouldn't look right. This is maybe a c4 texture that's curly naturally. Just pull the hair and rod it. Well, now Ms. Hunter's premise is she wouldn't rod it based on how tightly curled the natural hair is...so the service would not have ever been performed because ""it would NOT look done."" Thank you for that but just give what's requested. We literally didn't want heat on the hair and so long as it was rolled we would have been perfectly happy. How would this have been known?? If this was the ""true"" issue then it could have been presented to me and I would have signed off on it. That's how. Well,TODAY, I was caught at the door my a leader supervising (after speaking with Hunter and the other employee instructor that was present) to sign off on the hair work. This is new as it wasn't asked before. I then run the theory that was just provided to me by Hunter. If the style won't look right will it be omitted? He was confused. I restated and then he provided the taught outcomes: Never say no to a client. but you can say no to a service. sounds reasonable. He provides: if a service can't be performed then they will offer two (2) alternatives. He goes on to say he wasn't here so he doesn't know what happened last time. My point: if that's the policy then it's immaterial who's present or not. Everyone should execute said policy and process. Whoa!!! Now, I'm decidedly disgusted. On top of that I learned today...it's $12 for the wash and dryThen another $12 for the flat iron. Quit it....This is why Regency is out of business AND EXACTLY WHY I believe Paul Mitchell has  limited their students to only a few types of texture hair. What I mean? If you only get to practice on 2 or 3 hair types.... when will you ever learn how to do all hair textures/types? S/N: Our fully licensed salon and separate stylists only charge $30/for cut, style and that includes sit under dryers. It's just that she's allllllllll the wayyyy over by UNCC and this is really right on the Gold line and coming from Uptown this location works for me. Price aside...

I love that they lock the doors. Sunlight or evening - locked! 1 star for braids slipping out the 1st week. Like day 3 and 4 several (meaning more than six - 6) braids slid or fell out. I did return and the ladies that didn't do the initial work were not present. No one complained they simply got to work - no waiting. When I went to ask why is this happening as I read the other reviews - they summoned over someone who could speak English so I broke out my patois and carry on. It was explained it could be a few things - short hair, braided too loose, something else and I had to break into Frenglish because I can't say somethings in patois plus it's Creole French at best not even Haitian creole french so I struggle more than any other speaker. IN short we had to establish the hair isn't short and we've been wearing braids for at least eight years and only experienced this for the first time. Anywhoo, the braids fell out again plus 2 more.

I tipped as they used two ladies and got the work done in 3 hours maybe 3.45 hours. Well, tonight 11/21 - we finally got the missing braids redone and the braider was shocked that her first braids put in SLID OUT WHILE the client was still in the chair. I was sooo excited this happened as it stopped everything and made the ladies all get involved to figure out the possibilities of what's going on. I am starting to believe it's the hair. Look y'all, we don't allow tight braiding as we still have edges in this family. Folks have been braiding this hair from Wisconsin to Aabie's in the Queen City. Braids just don't slide out. Also, they talked the kid out of the big box braids and I get it they didn't want things to look old and cost a lot of $$ before the time should be up for a rebraid. At the end of the day - I'd like to give higher stars but I'm stretching with the 3 because I like the safety, cleaniness, ladies that work here and location.",3,3,5Iil77lF09sh_jsasPQcfA,11/22/2015,3,1,8,Beauty & Spa

It really pains me to say this, but I'm tired of my experiences.I've had my hair colored 3 times now since last November, and it has been what I have asked for and fantastic!  That is one area that I can't complain about, but I hope to find someone that can duplicate.My cuts have really been the issue.  The last time was the only time that I truly loved my cut.  All others have been good, but not exactly what I have wanted.  This time was just bad.I think the issue is that my stylist blow dries out my hair so big, not at all how I style it, so it is hard for me to see the actual length and layers.  It's styled for her instead of me.  So, I like it at the time, but when I get home, I immediately straighten it out, then I see what it really looks like and how I would see it on a day to day basis.I like my main length and then my layers to be very different.  Typically, my current stylist and any other stylist I've been to create the layers too close to my main length for my liking.  This week, I asked for my main hair to be just below the shoulders and my layers to be chin length.  My stylist did not want to go that short, so I said fine, don't cut it that much.  She proceeds to blow dry it big after the cut, but in the end, I ask for it to be cut more.  She again didn't think that was a good idea, but cut it to my liking.  She mentioned she liked it, but liked my hair longer (really inappropriate to say to a client).  Thanks though.This is the issue with blow drying out the hair big.  I get home, straighten it, and looking at the main length, there were two small sections that were longer than everything else.  They did not look right at all, as if they had been missed.  Then looking at my layers, which are not chin length, they are longer and closer to my main layer.Just in the end I am frustrated I did not get what I asked for and I want to go to someone who can ultimately be willing to give what I ask for.",0,0,9_1qX-pcBxRlObT60dhF9w,6/29/2017,2,0,18,Beauty & Spa

Had I had another hair stylist, this could have possibly been another 4 star review.  My review with Jewell still stands, but my experience yesterday needs to be mentioned.  Most of my 1 star reviews are because of bad customer service, and this is no different.I walked in and was told it was a 30-40 minute wait.  I decided to wait it out, it actually did not take that long to wait, but here is my issue...  There were only two stylist working and they were super busy after the work day was over for most people.  I had just watched them finish with 3-4 people and there were still three people waiting at the store and three people had just signed in online, so you knew it was going to be continuously busy.  At that time, one of the hair stylist went out back.  One of the guys that checked in online came in and asked if there was just one stylist there.  The other stylist said ""there is another one here but she went out back, not sure why she went out back, but she did.""  Not only did this one stylist make it look bad for Great Clips to go take a smoke break when you have essentially 6 people waiting, but she also made it bad for her coworker to have to give an excuse to incoming customers about her break.  Just great, I was the next in line for this person because the other two in front of me wanted to wait for the other stylist.  I could have done the same, but I decided to go ahead with her.  Of course after having a smoke break, she reeked of smoke.  Not everyone appreciates that smell or wants your smoke hands to be working with their hair.There is a time and place for smoke breaks, but not when you have six people waiting and have a haircut to do immediately after.Aside from all of that, my haircut was pretty good, but she did not really like it when I wanted to cut my hair a little bit more than originally requested.

It was fairly quiet for a Saturday afternoon, which I really appreciated since many nail salons are loud and all about moving people in and out quickly, but I got her undivided attention.  The pedicure itself was $28, which I thought was a smidgen steep but they also give you the cute pedicure flips flops, so I'll deal with it.  I was in and out in 45 minutes, and they were the most relaxing 45 minutes I've had in a long time.

I stopped in around noon on a Friday for a polish change since I thought that would be an easy, less intense way to check it out than a manicure or pedicure.Blue Sky is on the far end of a strip mall-ish facility, so the inside definitely felt very sterile to me (and not sterile like you want a nail salon to feel); the walls were white, the floor was tile, there was nothing on the walls, and there was no TV. It looked like they were planning to install one, so maybe they're still getting their decor down. However, it did seem very clean, and I saw a couple of rooms that were used for waxing. But I digress!When I walked in, I told the two women behind the front desk that I needed a polish change. They asked hands or toes; I said hands, and that was the last time anyone spoke to me in English. They appeared to have a gel bar, which was pretty cool, but I'm a basic polish girl, so I I started looking for a color. Their selection was a seriously limited for natural/nude colors. They had OPI and another brand I didn't recognize, and the first color I picked looked like White Out on my nails. The technician nicely let me change and came up to the wall to help me pick. I wound up going with Bubble Bath - the only nude-ish color they had - which still isn't my favorite, but I wasn't sure how to leave halfway into a service.The technician was nice enough, and I appreciated that she filed and buffed my nails and used cuticle oil since some other places literally just change your polish on a polish change.When I left, there were two different women at the front desk/cash register. Neither of them spoke to me - they spoke to each other, trying to figure out their computer system and how much I owed them. There's a huge menu on the wall, so I pointed at it and said, ""It looks like I owe $8, right?"" The woman nodded and opened the cash register. I gave her a $20 and asked for $10 back, which she silently gave me, and I walked out.Maybe they're still trying to get their feet under them and learn their systems, but customer service was pretty crummy and the ambiance leaves a little to be desired. There were a couple of other women getting pedicures/manicures, and one of them had wine (perk!) and the other was having all kinds of conversation with her technician, so maybe my experience was a one-off?",4,1,f2kDxs69Ivbu7qkBZWW8SA,6/30/2017,3,0,28,Beauty & Spa

Sheesh. She also didn't explain a lot of the questions she was asking. When she asked for my license, I skeptically handed it over... a few minutes later, she told me that my wax was half off since it was my first time and I was local. Would've been nice to know from the get-go!The waiting room was small but clean, and Kylie came to get me about 5 minutes after I sat down. She was so nice and normal and talked to me during the whole wax, which I appreciated to lessen the awkwardness. EWC uses a type of wax that goes on hot, then hardens as it cools, so there are no paper strips (which is what I've always had). I was a little skeptical at first, but it was fantastic - way less painful than hot wax slathered on your skin and then papers rubbed on! It took maybe 15-20 minutes to do the whole thing, and I never felt uncomfortable. Kylie said she'd been an aesthetician for 12 years, and I completely trusted her.When it comes to waxing, it's realllly hard to find 1) a good waxer who's 2) normal and comfortable 3) at a salon 4) with a website that lists all their services/prices and 5) accepts bookings online and 6) takes credit cards.
