Yelp is a website where users can write reviews about local businesses such as restaurants, markets, home services etc.
The dataset of this project is downloaded from the eleventh round of Yelp Dataset Challenge. 
This dataset contains three major types of data: businesses, users and reviews. 
A user can write positive or negative reviews for many businesses. 
Currently the Yelp website lists and visualizes the best businesses (e.g. restaurants) according to number of their positive reviews on 
the map. 
In this project, our visualization is emphasized on the users, not the businesses. 
First we found the most influential Yelp users (whom are gourmets or journalists writing on food section of newspapers) and then list 
businesses or restaurants they like, because it is more like a expert opinion or review it that specific business type.
